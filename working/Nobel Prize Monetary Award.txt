How much does a nobel prize winner get?
Editar
Nobel Prize winners receive approximately 11 million Swedish kronor, which is roughly $1 million USD (the exact amount varies with exchange rates). This prize money is shared among winners if there are multiple recipients in the same category.
The Nobel Foundation sets the prize amount each year. In addition to the monetary award, winners also receive a gold medal and a diploma at the Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm (or Oslo for the Peace Prize).
If there are multiple winners in a category, they split the prize money equally. For example, if three people share the Nobel Prize in Physics, each would receive about $333,000.

Do you know the movie A Message From the King?
Editar
Yes, "A Message From the King" is a 2016 action thriller starring Chadwick Boseman. He plays Jacob King, a man who travels from South Africa to Los Angeles to search for his missing sister and ends up seeking revenge against those who wronged her.
The film also features Teresa Palmer and Luke Evans in supporting roles. It's a gritty, neo-noir style revenge thriller that showcases Boseman in a more dramatic action role. The movie had a limited theatrical release and was also available on Netflix.
Are you thinking about watching it, or did you have a specific question about the film?

We we we talked about traffic. In the movie yesterday.
Editar
I think there might be some confusion - we haven't talked before since I don't retain information between conversations. Each chat with me starts fresh.
But if you're referring to traffic scenes in "A Message From the King," the movie does have some intense chase and action sequences through Los Angeles. Are you thinking of a particular traffic scene from the film that stood out to you?

He gets called over by a cop for having a, expired registration. And then they arrest him for not having a license.
Editar
Yes, that's right! That scene shows how Jacob King gets caught up in the system despite being in LA for legitimate reasons - searching for his sister. The expired registration and lack of a proper US license becomes a legal issue that complicates his mission.
It's one of those moments that highlights how vulnerable he is as a foreigner navigating the American legal system while trying to find answers about what happened to his sister. Did that scene stand out to you as particularly tense or realistic?
