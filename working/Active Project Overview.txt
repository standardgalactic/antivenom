Let me know if you want to dig deeper into any of these!
You said:
Give a longer explanation of each
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Here's a more detailed explanation of each project on your prioritized list, to capture their goals, scope, and current focus:
1.
Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) Theory
This is your core cosmological theory proposing that the universe's large-scale structure and dynamics emerge from interactions between a scalar entropy field, a vector baryon flow, and a geometric tessellation (Voronoi-Delaunay) governed by relativistic dynamics. The theory challenges standard ΛCDM cosmology by modeling space as an entropic plenum exhibiting outward "falling" dynamics rather than expansion. Your work includes rigorous mathematical formalization, lattice-based numerical simulations, and designing multi-modal experimental frameworks to test and potentially falsify RSVP's predictions against cosmological observations.
2.
TARTAN (Trajectory-Aware Recursive Tiling with Annotated Noise)
TARTAN is a computational framework you developed within RSVP for simulating and visualizing multiscale field dynamics. It uses recursive tiling and semantically rich noise perturbations annotated with trajectory memory to encode and render complex entropic relaxation patterns. The goal is to create interpretable, scalable simulations of the scalar-vector-entropy fields evolving across space and time, enabling both qualitative and quantitative analyses that support RSVP's claims and provide a bridge between abstract theory and empirical data.
3.
Unistochastic Quantum Theory & RSVP Synthesis
This theoretical project explores the idea that Jacob Barandes's unistochastic reformulation of quantum mechanics can emerge naturally from RSVP's underlying scalar-vector-entropy dynamics. You're working on formal mappings and proofs to show how probabilistic quantum transitions and interference patterns arise as coarse-grained, emergent phenomena from the deterministic, relativistic plenum dynamics of RSVP. This synthesis aims to unify quantum theory and cosmology in a novel framework, offering fresh insights into the quantum-classical boundary.
4.
Polymorphic Keyboard-Motion Mapping System for Poi Spinning
This is a practical and creative system mapping a 26-letter keyboard alphabet to a complex set of poi-spinning motions and patterns, across three dynamic modes: Basic Movement, Pattern Variation, and Expression/Dynamics. The system enables choreographic notation, live performance control, and avatar animation, integrating real-time inputs from MIDI devices, keyboard, and IMU sensors. The goal is to create a flexible, intuitive language for movement that can drive digital avatars and support artistic improvisation or routine creation.
5.
Holographic Steganography & Dynagraphic Compression
This technical project involves developing advanced algorithms for sparse recursive compression and holographic steganography—techniques that encode complex spatial and temporal information efficiently by leveraging entropic and geometric structure. These tools underpin your simulation frameworks like TARTAN, allowing for scalable representation and transmission of large field datasets, with applications to visualization, data integrity, and even autonomous vehicle sensory data processing.
6.
Spherepop: Bubble-Based Programming Language
Spherepop is an experimental programming language inspired by model-free cognitive methods and the epistemic frameworks of Monica Anderson. It's designed around "bubbles" — self-contained units of computation or logic that can interact in loosely coupled, modular ways. The language aims to support intuitive, exploratory programming styles that mirror natural human reasoning and cognitive patterns rather than strict symbolic manipulation, enabling flexible development in AI, simulation, or knowledge representation.
7.
Blastoids: Retro 3D Cockpit Shooter Game
Blastoids is a creative, fun side project—a retro-style 3D cockpit shooter inspired by classic games like Descent. The player defends a mostly stationary position against incoming asteroid threats, with minimal but strategic ship movement and aiming. The aesthetic is deliberately old-school, using green vector graphics, CRT-style glow, glitch effects, and a nostalgic arcade vibe. This project serves as a playground for rapid prototyping, graphics experimentation, and game design practice.

Spherepop
reflecting its true inspirations:
6.
Spherepop: Bubble-Based Programming Language
Spherepop is an experimental programming language inspired by the formal foundations of
lambda calculus
and
nested abstract syntax trees (ASTs)
. It uses "bubbles" as modular, self-contained computational units that can be composed and nested to represent complex program structures and logic hierarchies. The design emphasizes flexible, recursive composition of functions and data, enabling expressive, symbolic manipulation akin to functional programming but with a visual or conceptual "bubble" metaphor. Spherepop aims to provide an intuitive yet rigorous environment for exploring program structure, higher-order functions, and symbolic computation in a way that bridges formal logic with practical coding workflows.
