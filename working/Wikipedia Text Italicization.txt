Is there a Wikipedia format to italicize text?
Editar
Yes, in Wikipedia (which uses MediaWiki markup), you italicize text by surrounding it with two single apostrophes on each side:
''text to be italicized''
For example:
''Wikipedia''
displays as
Wikipedia
This is ''emphasized text'' in a sentence
displays as "This is
emphasized text
in a sentence"
This is different from standard Markdown, which uses single asterisks or underscores for italics. Wikipedia's markup system predates Markdown and uses its own conventions.
