for us " to have a sensation ", the robot cannot. Obviously, it is
not necessary to use the notion of " raw feel " to describe this
difference. We are only tempted now to use this notion if we say
" Ah, but 'to make a discrimination', etc., is not identical
and pathogenic remark is the result of overlooking the differences between
" consciousness " and stimulus words and expressions like " red shape ".
" Consciousness " does not seem to be the sort of thing that we experience,
or know immediately or directly.

with 'having a sensation '-it leaves out something ". But this
is an old objection by now, which we have already dealt with
in principle, and which is, in any case, quite independent of
puzzles about robots.
The second thing to note is how the unobserved departure
from the ordinary usage of 'robot' is apt to muddle us and to

make us overlook how we do use the word. If we found an"alleged
robot that behaved, overtly and covertly, just like a person as
far as adjusting to stimuli like red shapes and loud noises was
concerned, we would be in some doubt, and might say at least
two different things. We might say (a): " This thing obviously
has sensations, and is not really a robot at all, but some new
sort of thing altogether-some new type of organism ". That

etc.), stretch the use of 'organism' to cover it, and stick to
our usual criterion of " having a sensation ", viz., manifesting
the appropriate behaviour-readinesses, and covert and overt
behaviour. However, we might say (b): "This thing can't
really have sensations because we know it is a machine and not
