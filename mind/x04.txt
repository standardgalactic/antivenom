X reacted to different types of stimuli, it is clear that we were
not dealing with X's sensations at all, but with his behaviour;
and the discoveries that psychology claims to have made about

leaves out; and so no nearer providing a scientific account of it,
which could supplement the account given by physiology, and
thereby provide a reasonably complete picture of what happens
when we have a sensation, or feel, etc. This situation is ridiculous because, while psychology purports to be the scientific
