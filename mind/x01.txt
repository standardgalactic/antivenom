says that " Craik could only suggest that consciousness comes
in at certain points in the process of neural transmission where
the physiological patterns have a particular kind of definiteness.
On this hypothesis, we could tell what someone was thinking
if we could watch his brain at work, for we should see how one
pattern after another acquired the necessary brilliance and
definition."
This attitude of Adrian's seems fairly representative among
physiologists working in this field. They sufler severely from
the occupational disease of traditional dualism.1 Adrian's talk

is also illuminating because it brings out the acute difficulty
these neurologists are in. They would be only too thankful if
they could ignore the intervening mental events altogether.
What they would like to have is the assurance that they-as
physiologists and neurologists-can in principle give a complete
account of what happens when we think, recognise t-hings,
remember and see things; and that they are safe in ignoring the
mind and all intervening mental events whatever. But the road
to their professional heart's desire is blocked by what seem to
them overwhelming objections. In particular, there is the old
objection. To assert that a complete account of thinking, of
having a sensation, and so on, can be given in physiological
terms alone appears to entail that mental events are either
reducible to physiological and neural ones (which is absurd), or
else do not exist (which is false). So physiologists are reluctantly also ready to agree that any physiological and neural
account of what happens when we think, etc., even if it is a
definitive one for the time being, will leave out certain essential
parts or aspects of the total process-the parts or aspects " where
the mind comes in ". They might be inclined to express their
dissatisfaction with their own accounts like this: "When a
