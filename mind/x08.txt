psychologists more immediately than those- from ordinary discourse.

But of course sentence A is also quite different from sentences
1, 2 and 3. Take sentence 1. What we leave out here is some-

thing that Y can tell us about. We might say of him: " Can't
he be persuaded to be a bit more open and tell us what he really
feels about our proposal ? ". Or " If Y goes on being so secretive
and withdrawn, I shall persuade him to go for psychological
advice. Perhaps the chance to talk to a sympathetic person
may help him to get things off his chest." Contrast this with
X in sentence A. What is left out here is something that X
cannot in principle tell us about. He has already given us a
lengthy verbal report, but we say that this is not enough. We
want to include something over and above this, viz., X's experience. It is useless to ask X to give us further reports and to
make further discriminations if possible, because these reports
and discriminations are mere behaviour and leave out what we
want. It is obviously pointless, therefore, to recommend X to
go to an analyst, so that he can then tell us about the experience
he has when he looks at a red shape and that we have so far
ignored.

The same sort of differences hold for sentences 2 and 3 as
