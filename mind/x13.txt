it does not seem to be.
But I have been saying quite a lot of things about experience
in the course of this paper-if not positive, then at least negative,
things. Thus, for example, I have said: " X's experience is
such that there is nothing about it that X can discriminate ".
If this is to be true, then presumably I am saying something
about experience, if only in the indirect way that negative
assertions do say things. But observe that, when I do come out
with this assertion, and others like it, what I say is easy to
follow and seems plausible because we are comparing it unconsciously with an assertion like " Ultra violet radiation cannot be
discriminated visually ", or " When I play a chord on a piano,
X just experiences a blur-he cannot discriminate a note ".
Yet my assertion about experience is quite unlike these examples
obviously. Because of this, it is a confusion-producing
assertion. It gives us the impression that we have been told
something about the raw feel experience, just as we really are
told something about ultra violet radiation, or X's experience
on hearing a chord.
Yet I have suggested that we say " X's (raw feel) experience
is featureless ". Should I have said this ? No ! It is equally
muddling. For it looks like saying: " The landscape in a dcsert
is featureless ", or " The faces in his paintings are quite featureless ", or " The Times is almost featureless ". But to say this
sort of thing is compatible with the something talked about

having all sorts of other "properties; to say " X's experience is
featureless " is not. If it is suggested again at this point that
what we can do is simply to reject it as non-existent, we are in
trouble too. For to say that X's experience does not exist, or is
