can do is to date X's responses. But suppose X, as subjectobserver, sets himself the task of dating the onset of a certain
raw feel experience, for example, the one that is supposed to

happen when he sees two changing shapes as equally elliptical.
When X times himself here, say by stopping a stop watch, all
that he can time is his " seeing "-e.g., his subvocal " Ah !
that's it ", his accompanying release of breath and muscular
tension, and so forth. What, therefore, he dates is the onsct of
his seeing the shapes as equally elliptical. Difficulties only
multiply if we now retreat and say " But we time the experience
indirectly by timing the behaviour that it accotapanies ?"
E.g. What sort of " accofhpanying " does this ghost do ?
*But surely we can say: " x's experience (in the raw feel sense,
of course) is not identical with Y's" ? The answer seems to be

EXPERIENCE


" No)" again. Obviously we cannot be saying here that. X's
experience differs qualitatively from Y's, because admittedly
neither have the sort of features that permits them to differ
qualitatively. If we are saying that X's experience is not
numerically identical with Y's, then presumably we are. saying
something like: "Oh no! Mr. Shaw is our grocer-not G.B.S." !;
"Its the same cheering you heard a minute or so ago"; "It was
the same explosion we both heard " I.e., we are presumably
talking about tbings, or processes, or events. But X's and Y's
experiences are not things, processes or events. We notice the

difference if we ask: "As they have no properties like 'red',

'long', 'loud', etc., how, in the first place, do we distinguish

these two processes (or events), viz., X's and Y's experiences, so
that we can then assert that they are not the same ? " In the
case of the cheering, or explosions, it is possible to do so. Here
