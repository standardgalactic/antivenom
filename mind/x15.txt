feels ", to refer to this unreferable something. For X's experience
is not the sort of thing that can be ignored or noticed, left out or

included. It is not the sort of thing of which one can fruitfully
say " It is a sort of thing ", and for which it is appropriate to
use nouns and pronouns at all.
The objection of the indescribable experience.
" But is the man crazy ? The argument so far has simply
not shown that experience is featureless. All that it has shown,
if that, is that our experience has no features that can be de-

scribed, or discriminated, or reported in a laboratory. But the

fact that it lacks such features does not entail that it' lacks all
features. For it may still possess features with which we can
only be acquainted. And this, of course, is the case. When,
for example, we look at a red patch, we all just know what it is
like to have the corresponding experience, and we all just know

how it differs from the experience we have when looking, at a
green patch. We cannot describe this difference. But what of
that ? The fact that we cannot describe it should not be used
to suggest the absurdity that nothing of the sort exists. We
only land in this absurdity by restricting the sort of observations
psychology can make to the observations of a third party (or
subject), and by restricting acceptable observation-sentences to
those in the third person. If we do this, it is no wonder that
we are restricted to the observation and recording of behaviour
and that we feel we are leaving out experience."

What makes this plausible ? The fact that this situation
appears to resemble stacks of cases where we. do say or believe
that some experience can only be appreciated at first hand, and
