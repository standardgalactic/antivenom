left behind as inadequate treatments of the problem involved.
It shows, for example, in a new way just what an extraordinary

speaking of " foundational " psychology alone. My remarks at this point,
therefore, do not apply to social psychology and to subjects like the
psychology of personality.


doctrine is Reductive Materialism, and how equally extraordinary is the usual refutation of it. This conclusion also
reveals the queerness in a question like: How do I know I am
conscious?; and suggests, as we have noted, that "my
consciousness " is not the sort of thing I am immediately aware
of. It also has a bearing on the " other minds " puzzle. For
the question: " Do you feel pain when you squeak ? " is bogus
in so far as it is a question about a " raw feel "; but it is empirical
and difficult in so far as it is a request for further information
about your covert responses.
A point about method. I have already mentioned one respect
in which my remarks in this paper may not be of help. There
is another, even more obvious respect. I said at the outset that
this paper would be an attempt to deal with a problem felt by
physiologists and psychologists. But what I have done (in fact)
is to treat the difficulty as I felt it by doing some " self-analysis "
(to borrow Karen Horney's term). The paper represents a
summarised record of some of that self-analysis. This will only
be of service to physiologists and psychologists in so far as I
have appreciated the problem as it confronts them. To obtain
this appreciation I have tried to observe their behaviour in
respect of it. But this is a very difficult thing to do well; and
my effort at what social anthropologists would call " field work "
was quite certainly not careful enough. So my appreciation of
the psycho-physiologists' problem is likely to be defective. Consequently, my self-analysis may not be nearly as helpful to them
as I should like it to be.
