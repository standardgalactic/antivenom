at first hand for oneself. But obviously there is a world of
difference between the two-a difference that we recognise if we
are not suffering from Left Wing perversity. And it is this

immediate experience that I am interested in when I wonder
what it is like to be a Martian."
This objection is puzzling because' it is so very compelling

and yet hardly bears looking at. What is it " t6 know something
at first hand " ? When we say, for example, " I know at first
hand what it is like to smoke opium ", we are normally.saying
that other people need not tell me what it is like, because I
know this already; that I could, if pressed, produce a lengthy
description of it; that, if deliberately given some other drug I
could tell the difference unaided, and, if asked how I told the
difference, say: "This stuff hasn't the kick of opium" or
something of the sort. And so on. But this is not the use of
" know at first hand " in this objection. For here " to know at
first hand " of the experience of the opium smoker and the
Martian is to know something that other people cannot tell me
about, that is not describable at all, and that is such as to make
nonsense of the question: "How do you. tell the difference
between opium and the stuff you are smoking now ? ". Again,
when we normally talk about " knowing at first hand ", we are
contrasting this with " knowing at second hand ", i.e., learning
from someone else. But with what is " knowing at first hand
of the experience of the Martian " to be contrasted ? Not with
" knowing at second hand ", because this is logically impossible.
Not with " knowing it from my own description ", because this
