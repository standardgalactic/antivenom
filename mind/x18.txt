example: " Oh, -its bright, uniformly red ", and so on. If we
overlook this capacity to react symbolically to one's own re-

enquire what actually happens when we do so, then we are
liable to assert, with a flourish and an air of -importance, that
" we just know how looking at a red disc differs from looking
at a green one ". In other words, we are then liable to mistake
features of our responses to the disc for some indescribable and
ineffable property of the experience.
One consequence of all this. It makes no difference if a
psychology allows or emphasises observation-sentences in the
first person. " Experience " still remains featureless, and our
observation and our recording cannot include it no matter how
hard we try.
It is appropriate at this point to return to the difficult cases
where it still seems to be essential to keep the distinction between
"behaviour " and " experience ". I only have space to consider
two of these cases-the Martians and the robots.

A difficult cztse. The Man from Mars. (a) " What it would be

like to be a Martian ".

Suppose we had obtained from our Martian visitor all the
information that we, as psychologists and physiologists, could
obtain about his smnsory capacities. We should probably still
want to say: " I wonder what it would be like to be a Martian
-with his pseudo-radio sense, able, for example, to listen to
whatever wave length he chooses. Extraordinary! ". This
seems to be a perfectly sensible remark. But if there was nothing
