in order to discover whether we do need the distinction between
" behaviour " and " experience " to talk about them. But this
may be. a little premature and produce unnecessary resistance.
So I shall try another tack first.

Why this experience is so odd.
I shall say that the experience of X, which we are alleged to
be leaving out, is featureless. This is in contrast with the
experiences referred to in sentences 1, 2 and 3 above. The experience of X is featureless because there is nothing about it
that X can discriminate. If he does discriminate something
that appears to be a feature of the experience, this something

at once becomes, roughly, either a feature of the stimulus in the
sort of way that the saturation of the red in the red shape is a
feature of the red shape, or a feature of his own responses to the
shape. X merely provides us with further information about
the behaviour that he does and can perform.
But surely this is mistaken ? Surely it is wrong to say that

it has no features F For, even if it is always false to say of the
experience we are leaving out that e.g. " It is red ", or " It is
extended ", what of the so-called " formal " predicates or properties- ? No doubt we cannot say of it that it stands in spatial
or causal relations to anything else. But surely we can say, e.g.
"At least X's experience happens ". Surely, that is, we can
say that it stands in " temporal relations " to other events or
processes ? No-this will not do. For to say that " something
or other happens quite frequently " is to say that the something
occurs at diflerent times. To say this is to say that this something is in principle datable. How now do we set about dating
the occurrence that is X's experience at any time ? All we
