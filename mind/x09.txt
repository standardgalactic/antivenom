well. This can be seen by imagining that the ape and the child
were suddenly given the gift of human adult speech and the
discriminatory capacity that goes with it. They would then
give us the same sorts of reports that X gives us in the laboratory,
and tlhereby enable us to include what we might have been in
real danger of leaving out of our account of how they (ape and
child) solve problems-viz., that they too cogitate, have wants
and so on. Again, therefore, it is quite obvious that what we
were in danger of leaving out in the cases of the ape and the
child is quite different from what we feel we are leaving out in
the case of X.
At this point the commonsensical objection is useful (that
we must be leaving out X's experience if we only consider his
behaviour) because it emphasises that we do not normally use
" experience " and " behaviour " as synonyms, but more often
than not as contrasts. Thus, e.g., you might say: " I did nothing
but felt a shiver down my spine "; or we might say: " Those
factory hands who do a routine job usually have a rich day
dream life "; or " He plays tennis quite well but he still does
not enjoy it ". In these examples, it would be quite wrong, or
odd, English to describe your shiver, the day dream life of the
factory hands, or the joyless experience of the tennis player as

EXPERIENCE


"behaviour". This contrasting use of " behaviour " and
"experience" reinforces our tendency to say that behaviour
sentences inevitably " leave out " the person's experience. But,
of course, when we look more closely at the sentences where we
do use " experience " in a way that contrasts with behaviour,
already mentioned, also differ from sentence A in the same sort

of way. The experiences of the factory hands and the tennis
player are describable, the " left out " experience of X is not.
This normal use of " behaviour " and " experience" draws
