study of experience, and lip-service is paid to this attempt in the

usual definitions of its subject matter, the science, in effect,
does not include experience within its purview. What psychologists feel the science should somehow also include is, for

qualities, emotional states, and so forth. But all this is just
what contemporary psycshology does not include and do. The
fact that the subject X and the psychologist himself both have
sensations, and so forth, is simply ignored.

reactions, discriminations, behaviour-readinesses, and so on.
But he cannot bring himself to do so. For he sees himself faced
