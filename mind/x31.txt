treated in the sort of way I have tried to do above. In the course
of doing this, the gaps in my diagnosis of this philosophical
problem will be amply revealed.
The relevance of this account.

Let me summarise the bearing of all this on the problem that
faces the physiologists and psychologists.
We noted the crucial difficulty that faces the physiologists.
If their science is to give a complete account of what happens
when a person, for example, sees something, this mental event or
process of " seeing " is either reducible to, and so identical with,
some neural events, or else it does not exist. Neither alternative is acceptable. Hence it cannot give a complete account.
Now, if it is said that a simple reflex reaction, like the knee
jerk, is just a matter of certain neural events or processes, and
can be completely accounted for in neural-terms, neither plain
man nor physiologist resists this suggestion. But if it is said
that " seeing " is just a set of neural events, no matter how
complex, we all protest because we want to say that " seeing "
is not just a matter of reacting, as the knee jerk was, but something else as well, which is now being left out. I have tried to
point to some of the sources of this protest. If we appreciate
them, we may then be readier to appreciate the futility (a) of
