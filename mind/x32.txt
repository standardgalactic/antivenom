saying: " But when I see something, all that is happening is
that certain neural events (or processes) are taking place "; and
(b) of adding: " This is false " (or " absurd " or some similar
remark). It is futile to say (a) because the ordinary discourse
of plain men and physiologists makes it patently false. This
leaves them very uneasy about the proposed identification with
nervous processes, and vulnerable to the usual objections against
it. Their uneasiness becomes intolerable when they are trapped
-into discussing the question by means of the antithesis of
" mental " and " material ", or " mental " and " neural ". For
this use of " mental " is itself a product of the dualistic tradition
in philosophy. Hence to argue for identity by means of the
words "mental" and "material " is to use self-destructive
weapons. But it is equally futile to say (b) "It is false (absurd)
to identify ' seeing ' with any neural events ". For this suggests
that it is quite all right to presuppose there are two sorts of
events here anyway. But, if pressed, we can only defend this
presupposition by falling back on " seeing " as a raw feel experience. I hope this is clear from what has already been said.
When we do appreciate this, we also see the point of saying
that mental events are identical with neural ones. But if the

" mental events " are the queer " raw feels ",.that we have discussed, then we also see that it is absurd to try to identify them
with neural ones, because they are not the sorts of things that
can be identified with anything else. They a2re not like the
transmission of an electric current that can be identified with
the passage of a nervous impulse. So even to talk about "seeing "
etc., and "neural events " in the way that this traditional
Adrian-cum-Ewing line 1 does talk about them will just produce
intellectual confusion.
Similar remarks apply to the parallel difficulty that confronts
