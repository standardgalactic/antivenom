cannot be described at all. " Oh! I cannot possibly begin to
tell you what it was like-you must experience it for yourself."
And the 'it ' here may be anything from the beauty of the Alps
or the thrill of ski-ing, to the prophetic character of the Epilogue
of R. Vaughan Williams's Sixth Symphony and the esoteric
pleasures of the professional philosopher. This sort of remark,
moreover, is a well-established response with all of us, since it
goes back to childhood. The child is continually being put into
situations in order to appreciate them and learn about them;
and he is continually being told: " Oh, you must wait until you
are old enough to go to a pantomine yourself, and then you will
know what it is like ". Clearly, descriptions are pitifully poor
conveyors of the qualities of an experience, especially to a child,
because, to say no more, descriptions invariably do an injustice
to the discriminations actually made and to the excitement with
which they are made.
But is the indescribable experience of seeing a red patch like
any of these ? No-it differs in the relevant respect. When
we say " We can't describe the experience of seeing a red patch "
(in the raw feel sense) the " can't " is logical. When we say
" We can't describe the prophetic character of the Epilogue of
R. V. W.'s Sixth Symphony, you have to hear it for yourself ",
the 'can't' is the " hopeless " can't. No matter how carefully
and intelligently the critics talk about it, they cannot work me
up in the way the Epilogue itself can. If, however, X's seeing
red patches in the past had occurred in unpleasant circumstances,


B.

A.


and X had acquired a horror of the things, then I might say:
" I can't describe the unpleasant character that a red patch has
for X ". And then I would be using the " hopeless " can't.
