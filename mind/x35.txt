Behaviourist jargon will only arouse opposition and do little, if
anything, to treat the intellectual confusion we are all in. It is
partly for this reason that the recommendations of Physicalists
and the American Behaviourists have been of such little help.
The place where recommendations are appropriate (when they
are appropriate at all) is at the end of a diagnosis of a philosophical difficulty. For we can then better appreciate their
value and their limitations. The few recommendations I shall
offer briefly must be placed and read in this context.

The negative ones first. Do not contrast mental and material
(or physical) events, or mental and neural (or physiological)
events. Do not therefore talk about " gaps " between them, e.g.,
the gap between the sticking of a pin into my finger and the
appearance of a sensation of pain in my consciousness. Do not,

and " intensity of experience ". For psychologists in particular,
I suggest the following. Do not succumb to the current-physiological talk about " sensations " and " feelings " because of the
prestige of physiology as the science that is foundational to
psychology. Accept physiological discoveries gratefully, but do
not feel committed to using the terminology in which physiologists express them or talk about them. Do not, e.g., take over
