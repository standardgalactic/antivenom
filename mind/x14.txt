is quite unlike saying:
1. Unicorns are unreal, Johnny.
2. There is no such process. as perpetual motion.
3. Dodos don't exist any more.

4. There are no round squares.

5. No prime number exists between 19 and 23.

Unicorns are unreal because they are the creations of legend
and heraldry. Perpetual motion is a physical impossibility.
Dodos are extinct. There are no round squares because the
concept is self-contradictory; and there is no prime number
between 19 and 23 for logical reasons, since it can be proved
quite simply that there is not one. 'X's experience' is quite
unlike these cases. For one thing, we know what it is we are
denying in these cases; with X's experience we do not. The
snag is that we cannot discuss the question without using a
substantive, like " experience ", and the pronoun " it " (as in

" It is featureless "). Bat this at once traps us into supposing
that we are talking about some thing, process or event or state
of affairs (or what not), to which this noun and pronoun, like
other nouns and pronouns, are being used to refer. Obviously
they are not being used in this way here, however difficult it is
to get clear just how they are being used.

The upshot so far, then, is that to talk about X's experience
as a process, or an event etc. is just confusion producing. It
is foolish to say that it has, or has not any, features. It is
foolish to label it as a shadow or ghostly process on the model
of Ayer (in Thinking and Meaning), and then deny that it
occurs. In particular, it is foolish to say that physiology and
psychology ignore it and leave it out. There is no need whatever for Adrian to imagine that he is in danger of leaving anything

out; and it is folly for Tolman to invent a special term, " raw
