are red, yellow, green, blue, white and black ").
In experimenting on X as subject, it is not necessary for the
psychologist to make X talk to him. In principle, everything
he wants to know can be discovered by making X behave like a
dog and depress keys or open lids or perform some such motor
response that shows the psychologist he has made the discrimination in question. Just as we can discover that a dog can
distinguish between red and green colours by successfully
training the dog to distinguish that the red light over a door
means it is open, whereas the green light means it is shut, so the
psychologist can in principle discover that X is or is not colour
blind, can or can not react to this or that variation in the stimulus
and so on. But of course, it is ever so much more convenient,
and indeed very often necessary at present with our limited
experimental techniques, to ask X to report what he does see.
Provided that these reports are of the very simple Yes-No
variety, and the psychologist has good reason to believe that X
is co-operating with him, there is no methodological objection
whatever for not also using X's verbal reports.
One further thing a psychologist also does. Quite often he
places himself in the role of subject. For laboratory purposes
it is often convenient for Wim to play the role of X. Now it may
or may not be the case that, when he does so, he makes observations of quite a different sort to those he makes when he merely
observes X reacting to the same stimulus-e.g. a red disc. I
