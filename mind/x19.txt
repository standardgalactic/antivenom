-more to be discovered about the Martian than his actual and
possible responses, then this would not be a sensible remark. We
would know what it would be like to be a Martian and there would
'be no point in wondering about it. So there is something more
to be learnt about the Martian, and that is what his experience
is like. Similarly for our wonderings about babies, mice and
lice.
Ntow we treat this remark (" I wonder what it would be like
to be a Martian ") as perfectly s3nsible because it resembles
remarks like:
1. " I wonder what it would be like to be an opium smoker."
2. " I wonder what it would be like to be, and hear like, a bat."
In 1 and 2 the only sort of answer that will satisfy me is the sort
of answer I will get if I became an opium smoker or a bat myself.
That is to say, I am imagining myself in the role of observersubject, i.e., the role of the privileged observer, and I will be
satisfied only with the sort of answer that I can then obtain.
The demand for this sort of answer here is quite reasonable,

because it is a contingent fact that I.am not an opium smoker
or a bat (after all, a witch could easily change me into a bat for
a day or so). Hence there is nothing absurd in the supposition
that I should become a privileged observer here. Similarly, my
wonder about the Martian seems to be the sort that can be
satisfied only by a privileged observer's answer. What.makes
this answer seem so imperative is that the Martian's experience
differs, ex hypothesi, from mine so much more than the opium
smoker's, or even the bat's. It is this vast difference that
inclines us to reject any attempted description of the Martian
experience as feeble and inadequate. Moreover, as with the
opium smoker and the bat, it is perfectly sensible to suppose
