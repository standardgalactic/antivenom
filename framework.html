<p>This deep dive explores the complex relationship between humans and
their digital tools, questioning whether current systems truly empower
individual thought or instead subtly shape how we process information.
The discussion begins with critiques of existing digital interfaces,
which are seen as often reducing thoughts into rigid, narrative-driven
formats that lack flexibility and depth, hindering intellectual
growth.</p>
<p>One of the central concepts introduced is “non-expanding shards,”
static systems lacking generative logic, platform expansion, emergent
goals, and strategic ambiguity. These are viewed as digital dead ends
that stunt cognitive development by offering superficial engagement
without fostering deeper understanding.</p>
<p>A significant critique is directed towards what’s termed
“podcastification,” the tendency of AI to expand all information into
narrative formats, regardless of its nature or utility. This is seen as
problematic for those who rely on precise, structured thought, like
individuals with anedophagia (lack of inner speech), who find value in
direct, unadorned information presentation.</p>
<p>The discourse then moves to propose alternative approaches centered
around the concept of “Schema-First Interface Protocol” (SFIP). SFIP is
a YAML-based format designed to allow users to express their thoughts as
structured, adaptable blueprints they fully control. It prioritizes
principles such as interpretation being opt-in rather than default,
cognitive neutrality accommodating diverse cognitive styles, compression
fidelity preserving original thought structure, and epistemic
sovereignty granting users ultimate control over their thoughts’ form,
rhythm, and visibility.</p>
<p>The core of SFIP is ‘schema objects’, which are basic units of
structured thought, devoid of narrative arcs. These can be combined to
create complex semantic graphs for specific purposes, such as definition
blocks holding precise definitions or gate conditions defining logical
rules.</p>
<p>SFIP also introduces different interaction modes (like construct and
glance) and export layers for controlled presentation of thoughts across
various platforms. Notably, while an optional narrative mode exists,
it’s often disabled by default to create a ‘consent firewall’,
preventing unwanted transformations of users’ thoughts.</p>
<p>The discussion further expands into ontological polycompilation, a
theoretical framework that extends constructor theory by David Deutsch.
This framework posits that meaning and complex behaviors emerge from
physical actions and the world around us through recursive substrate
symbol reappropriation (R).</p>
<p>R dynamically changes the function or meaning of a substrate,
evolving with learning. The symbol emergence condition dictates that
true symbols arise only from multiple recursive applications of R to the
same substrate (R^N where N &gt; 1). This theory suggests that our
bodies serve as ontological polycompilers, transforming physical actions
into symbolic meanings through overlapping substrates, reappropriation
of outputs, and recursive constructions.</p>
<p>This theoretical underpinning leads to a vision for future digital
interfaces that respect human cognition. The PlayCosm framework
critiques shallow gamification systems (non-expanding shards) for their
lack of generative logic and intellectual payoff. In contrast, the
Yarncrawler philosophy champions diverse values such as ‘Honor the
Knot’, advocating for respecting the messy complexities of thought and
resisting constant tracking and data collection.</p>
<p>The Plenum Weaver interface concept embodies these principles,
offering a human-centered expert system that dynamically routes user
input to specialized modules based on initial context declarations and
behavioral inference. Crucially, users maintain control through an
‘opacity switch’ in grief gate, allowing them to block inferences for
sensitive domains.</p>
<p>This deep dive concludes by underscoring the importance of cognitive
sovereignty—user control over thoughts and their representation—amidst
discussions on AI safety and the risks associated with expanding
knowledge, such as unbounded power, static societies, misconceptions
about nature knowing best, and unknown existential risks.</p>
<p>In essence, this exploration emphasizes that designing digital tools
is not merely about efficiency or engagement metrics; it’s fundamentally
about shaping our relationship with knowledge and understanding. The
choice between limiting interfaces (non-expanding shards) and fostering
cognitive sovereignty (a garden of cognition) hinges on principles of
user control, thoughtful design, and respect for the complexity and
diversity of human understanding.</p>
<p>The Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) theory, proposed by the
research group Flixian, is a highly ambitious framework that attempts to
unify various aspects of our understanding of reality, from physics and
neuroscience to artificial intelligence and cosmology. It’s built on
three fundamental fields—scalar, vector, and entropy—that interact in a
dynamic way over four-dimensional spacetime.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Scalar Field (φ):</strong> Represents semantic density or
energy concentration, essentially the ‘what’ of a system. In
neuroscience, it could represent neural activation strengths forming
coherent attractor spots where information is focused and
ordered.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vector Field (V):</strong> Captures flow or
directionality, the ‘how’ or ‘where to’ of information processing. It
directs movement and influence within a system. In cognition, it might
represent attention direction or entropy gradients.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Entropy Field (S):</strong> Quantifies ambiguity or
disorder in a system. The RSVP theory posits that any system strives to
minimize this entropy, leading to the emergence of structure and order
from apparent randomness.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These fields interact dynamically through coupling mechanisms like
diffusion and feedback loops, guided by partial differential equations.
They continuously influence each other, allowing for the
self-organization of patterns or ‘emergent coherence tiles’ within
complex systems—including brain structures.</p>
<p>In neuroscience, RSVP reinterprets cortical columns as dynamic,
context-dependent solutions (tiles) emerging from the interplay of these
fields rather than rigid structures. This interpretation aligns with
Geometric Bayesianism with Sparse Heuristics (GBSH), which suggests that
the brain’s efficiency arises from metabolic constraints necessitating
sparse processing.</p>
<p>Regarding AI, RSVP critiques current transformer architectures for
violating what they call the Natural Sparsity Principle (NSP).
Transformers’ dense self-attention mechanisms are deemed
energy-inefficient and noisy in comparison to biological cognition’s
sparsity. Instead, RSVP proposes Relevance Activation Theory (RAT) and
Aspect Religion Theory (RT), suggesting that attention emerges from
field dynamics rather than being a built-in mechanism.</p>
<p>In terms of AI governance, RSVP contributes to a three-tiered
framework for controlled AI takeoff: Tier one involves operating near
the ‘edge of chaos’, where information processing is optimal; Tier two
includes Predictive Coding to manage AI behavior based on continuously
modeling and minimizing prediction errors about human preferences; and
Tier three uses RSVP metrics to ensure that the AI’s decisions and
outputs preserve meaning, avoiding technically correct but semantically
hollow or harmful actions.</p>
<p>Zooming out to cosmology, RSVP aligns with Julian Barber’s timeless
physics idea by suggesting the universe’s history isn’t an evolution in
time but a path through static landscape configurations of ‘nows’. The
concept of Tartan (Trajectory-aware Recursive Tiling with Annotated
Noise) operationalizes this, depicting the universe as recursively
partitioned into coherence tiles. Each tile represents a mini-timeline
with its own entropic state and predicted future trajectory, implying
localized, scale-dependent time.</p>
<p>This perspective leads to an alternative cosmological model called
expirotic cosmology—a non-inflationary, non-singular model suggesting
large-scale structures arise over vast timescales via the gradual
reintegration of decohered early universe information encoded in the
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).</p>
<p>Throughout this grand framework, a unifying theme is the idea that
information processing across various domains fundamentally involves
geometric structure-preserving transformations that minimize entropy.
RSVP posits that consciousness might emerge naturally from these fields’
interactions as a recursive, entropy-modulated traversal of semantic
space.</p>
<p>The theory also ventures into more speculative territory, suggesting
that principles like computation, meaning generation, and ethical
grounding could be universal properties of complex systems organizing
themselves through field dynamics and entropy minimization. This
approach challenges conventional perspectives on the nature of time,
reality, intelligence, and consciousness, advocating for a
physics-grounded paradigm that views these phenomena as emergent from
dynamic, self-organizing fields striving towards coherence and
meaning.</p>
<p>The Flyxion Framework is a comprehensive, unified model that aims to
redefine our understanding of cognition, cosmology, and artificial
intelligence (AI) through the lens of field theory. At its core lies the
Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework, which models complex
systems using three interconnected fields:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Scalar Field (Φ):</strong> Represents semantic intensity or
potential, energy concentration, neural activation strength, or
structured potential. It encodes the distribution and diffusion of
interpretive or physical importance across spacetime.</li>
<li><strong>Vector Field (v⃗):</strong> Directs activation or inference
flow, attention direction, causal propagation, energy flow, or
directional flow of negentropy through spacetime. This field captures
the directed motion of information or energy within a system.</li>
<li><strong>Entropy Field (S):</strong> Quantifies uncertainty,
interpretive ambiguity, disorder, or uncertainty in physical or
cognitive systems. It drives systems toward low-entropy attractors and
suppresses noise to guide sparsity.</li>
</ol>
<p>These fields interact dynamically over a four-dimensional spacetime
(R4), governed by coupled partial differential equations that ensure
thermodynamic consistency and geometric principles. Understanding, in
this framework, emerges from recursive feedback within these fields
rather than external logical structures.</p>
<p>The framework is augmented by TARTAN (Trajectory-Aware Recursive
Tiling with Annotated Noise), a recursive engine that enables adaptive,
multi-scale computation through the partitioning of fields into
“coherence tiles” – regions characterized by low entropy and stable
dynamics. Each tile has its local field state, recursive density, scale,
entropy, and update schedule, constructing a discrete, memory-sensitive
path through configuration space. This hierarchical memory structure
allows for modular, hierarchical representations within the system.</p>
<p>A central principle guiding this framework is the Natural Sparsity
Principle (NSP), which asserts that biological cognition is sparse due
to metabolic cost, environmental noise, and thermodynamic gradients.
This principle underpins Flyxion’s critique of current AI architectures,
particularly Transformers, for their dense attention mechanisms, which
they argue violate NSP and diverge from the sparse, recursive nature of
biological cognition.</p>
<p>One key concept within this framework is that of <strong>Amplitwist
Operators</strong>. Cortical columns are hypothesized to function as
geometric transformation operators, specifically amplitwist operators,
within a semantic field. An amplitwist operator locally scales and
rotates infinitesimal circles in the complex plane. In the brain,
cortical columns perform analogous transformations on neural
representations, modeled as vectors in a high-dimensional manifold. This
enables flexible scaling, rotational invariance, and universal function
approximation via operator composition – fundamental aspects of
cognitive processing and potentially replicable in AI architectures.</p>
<p><strong>Expyrotic Cosmology</strong>, another core concept within the
Flyxion framework, presents a non-inflationary model for cosmic
structure formation driven by the reintegration of decohered CMB
information over long timescales. Here, the Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) is reinterpreted as a semantic horizon encoding patterns from the
early universe. Poincaré recurrence suggests that over sufficiently long
periods, RSVP fields can re-couple decohered CMB information, smoothing
entropy gradients and restoring structural coherence – offering an
alternative perspective on cosmic evolution distinct from inflationary
models.</p>
<p>In terms of AI development and governance, the Flyxion framework
proposes a <strong>Controlled AI Takeoff</strong> model comprising three
tiers:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Criticality</strong>: Employs thermodynamic thresholds to
regulate when an AI system should act or adapt based on its state,
pausing or accelerating development at phase boundaries to maintain
optimal performance and alignment with societal preferences.</li>
<li><strong>Predictive Coding</strong>: Manages how the AI system acts
by incorporating hierarchical inference and error correction, enabling
it to estimate human preference dynamics recursively and
adaptively.</li>
<li><strong>RSVP</strong>: Ensures that what constitutes meaningful
progress in AI development aligns with semantic coherence and structural
integrity, guiding the evolution of the AI’s cognitive landscape.</li>
</ol>
<p>This framework also introduces the <strong>Chain of Memory
(CoM)</strong> as a memory-first, latent reasoning approach for AI,
fundamentally different from the post-hoc rationalizations typical in
Chain of Thought (CoT) models. CoM encodes reasoning as structured
transformations within a latent memory space, providing epistemic
transparency by tying outputs to causal trajectories that can be audited
or perturbed for interpretability without relying on explicit linguistic
narration.</p>
<p>Beyond its applications in cosmology and neuroscience, the Flyxion
framework extends into AI design principles, emphasizing sparse,
recursive architectures aligned with natural cognition. It critiques
existing Transformer-based models</p>
<p>The Flyxion framework, centered around the Relativistic Scalar Vector
Plenum (RSVP) model, presents a unified approach to understanding
cognition, cosmology, and artificial intelligence (AI). This framework
posits that these complex systems emerge from the dynamic interplay of

<p>These fields evolve over a four-dimensional spacetime domain (R4),
governed by coupled partial differential equations that ensure
thermodynamic consistency and geometric principles. Understanding
emerges from recursive feedback within these fields rather than external
logical structures.</p>
<p>The framework is augmented by TARTAN, which provides scale-aware
recursion, enabling adaptive multi-scale computation through coherence
tiles—regions of low entropy with stable dynamics. Each tile has a local
field state, recursive density, scale, entropy, and update schedule,

<p>The Natural Sparsity Principle (NSP) is central to the Flyxion
framework, arguing that biological cognition is sparse due to metabolic,
environmental, and thermodynamic constraints. This principle underpins
the critique of current AI architectures, particularly Transformers,
which are deemed misaligned with biological plausibility and
efficiency.</p>
<p>Flyxion proposes a paradigm shift towards “sparse, plenum-based
architectures” that prioritize recursion, geometric structure, and
causal traceability. The Chain of Memory (CoM) framework is introduced
as an alternative to Transformer models, ensuring causal faithfulness by
encoding reasoning in latent memory states rather than linguistic token
sequences.</p>
<p>In cosmology, the Expyrotic Cosmology model reinterprets the CMB as a
semantic horizon, where decohered information is gradually reintegrated
over long timescales, leading to the formation of cosmic structures
without rapid expansion or singularities. This non-inflationary paradigm
makes distinct observational predictions and challenges standard
models.</p>
<p>For neuroscience, cortical columns are reinterpreted as dynamic
geometric transformers performing amplitwist operations on neural
representations, providing universal function approximation
capabilities. This framework aligns with biological constraints like
metabolic efficiency and sparse coding.</p>
<p>In AI development and governance, Flyxion introduces a “Controlled AI
Takeoff” model that modulates AI growth rates based on criticality,
predictive coding, and RSVP to ensure alignment with societal
preferences and semantic coherence. It also emphasizes sparse
architectures, causal traceability, and interpretability for enhancing
AI alignment.</p>
<p>The Flyxion framework’s overarching themes include unification across
disciplines through a common geometric principle, the primacy of
geometry in cognition and reality, recursion as fundamental to
understanding, and the exploration of time as emergent local scale
dynamics rather than an external parameter. Epistemic transparency,
anti-orthodoxy, thermodynamic principles, and meaning generation are
also key aspects of this framework, providing a holistic approach to AI,
neuroscience, cosmology, and narrative analysis.</p>
