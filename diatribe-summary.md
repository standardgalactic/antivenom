Core Thesis:
Facebook represents a structurally harmful system whose advertising-driven business model systematically degrades social reality, attention, and long-term human capacity—not as a side effect, but as a profitable feature of its design.

Key Arguments:

1. Advertising Without Legitimacy
      Facebook enables anonymous, ephemeral, and scalable advertising detached from traditional constraints (regulation, reputation, accountability), creating an environment dominated by deceptive, failure-compatible promotions.
2. Failure-Compatible Advertising
      The platform profits regardless of advertiser success, operating as a distributed loss-absorption mechanism. High advertiser churn is a feature, not a bug.
3. Hope Extraction
      Facebook monetizes aspiration under conditions of scarcity, targeting vulnerable users with narratives of rapid transformation (e.g., passive income, instant credentials), thereby eroding realistic planning and long-term agency.
4. Short-Form Media & Attentional Entropy
      Algorithmically curated short-form content (e.g., Reels) creates a high-entropy attentional environment that fragments focus, undermines sustained cognition, and displaces time for skill acquisition and deep learning.
5. Virtual Interaction vs. Embodied Practice
      While providing connection, virtual interaction cannot substitute for embodied, tacit knowledge transmission required for skills, crafts, and care. Over-reliance on symbolic exchange weakens social reproduction.
6. Structural Harm & Irreversibility
      Facebook operates as an extraction field that captures attention, externalizes costs, and narrows future possibilities. The resulting erosion of competence, trust, and skill transmission poses civilizational-scale risks that are cumulative and difficult to reverse.

Proposed Alternatives:

· Spherepop OS: A constraint-first interface designed to preserve attentional coherence through bounded contexts and low-entropy interaction.
· PlenumHub: A semantic infrastructure that prioritizes contribution coherence over engagement metrics, resisting extraction dynamics.

Methodological Approach:
The analysis uses a constraint-first, systems-theoretic framework (informed by thermodynamic analogies and RSVP modeling) to explain platform stability not through user satisfaction, but through structural constraints, exit costs, and path dependence.

Conclusion:
Facebook’s harms are structural, not incidental. Effective intervention requires redesigning the constraint fields that shape attention, time, and viable futures—shifting from moral critique to structural counter-measures that align system survival with human capacity rather than its depletion.
