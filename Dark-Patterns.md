# Dark Patterns: Generative Music Platforms as Predatory Cultural Infrastructure

This essay, *“Dark Patterns: Generative Music Platforms as Predatory Cultural Infrastructure,”* presents a normative critique of generative music platforms, using Suno as a primary example. It argues that these platforms, despite being framed as democratizing creativity, are designed in ways that systematically undermine musical agency, skill development, and cultural continuity.

## Core Thesis

Generative music platforms do not merely introduce a new tool for creativity. They reconfigure the entire ecology of musical practice in ways that displace learning, weaken authorship, and convert aspiration into dependence. What appears as empowerment is structurally closer to dispossession.

---

## Key Arguments

### 1. From Instrument to Proxy

Unlike traditional musical tools that extend human capability, generative systems like Suno act as *proxies*. They produce finished music on the user’s behalf while withholding the structural knowledge—chords, harmony, rhythm—needed for learning and genuine creative ownership.

Instead of amplifying agency, they substitute for it.

---

### 2. Erosion of Skill and Time

The platform promises instant musical output, bypassing the essential temporal process of practice, error, and gradual improvement. This corrodes the will to engage in the vulnerable, effortful work through which musical skill is actually formed.

What is lost is not just time, but the meaning of time as formative struggle.

---

### 3. Predatory Design Patterns (“Dark Patterns”)

Suno employs interface features that systematically harm user agency:

- **Autoplay**  
  Immediately plays others’ music after a user’s track, denying reflective silence and collapsing authorship.

- **Version Proliferation**  
  Generates multiple song variants simultaneously, diluting commitment and turning revision into a slot-machine-like gamble rather than a deliberate, learning-oriented process.

- **Withholding Musical Structure**  
  Deliberately obscures harmonic and compositional information, making users dependent on the platform to recreate or even understand their own music.

- **Conditional Ownership**  
  Positions full authorship and copyright as a paid-tier privilege, monetizing insecurity and transforming creative identity into a subscription feature.

These are not neutral UX choices. They are dependency-inducing mechanisms.

---

### 4. Pedagogical Failure and Disembodiment

The platform refuses to teach. It offers results without explanations.

Music is abstracted away from the body, discouraging physical practice—singing, playing instruments—through which skill becomes durable. The user is trained to prompt, not to perform.

This severs music from the sensorimotor foundations that make it a human craft.

---

### 5. Alignment with Extractivist Economics

These design choices are not oversights. They align directly with the platform’s business model, which prioritizes:

- user retention over user growth,  
- subscription dependence over independence,  
- content throughput over competence.

The system maximizes engagement by minimizing self-sufficiency.

---

## Proposed Ethical Alternative

The essay formalizes an alternative vision centered on **monotonically improving training environments**.

An ethical generative music system would:

- Provide full structural transparency by default.  
- Integrate embodied pathways to performance and practice.  
- Guide revision apprentically, not through parallel output.  
- Grant unconditional authorship and user sovereignty.  
- Refuse all dark patterns (e.g., mandatory autoplay).

Such a system would guarantee that increases in a user’s embodied skill produce non-decreasing aesthetic reward. Practice would once again mean progress.

---

## Conclusion

The central ethical question is not whether generative music platforms are technically impressive, but whether their current design deserves to exist.

By hollowing out skill, monetizing desire, and replacing pedagogy with dependency, platforms like Suno function as **predatory cultural infrastructure**. They do not merely host music; they restructure the conditions under which music can survive as a human practice.

The essay calls for a moral and architectural shift toward systems that cultivate musicians rather than extract value from musical aspiration.
