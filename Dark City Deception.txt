The "Dark City" Deception: A 2018 Korean Lab Conspiracy

The Foundation:
We start with the premise that "Dark City" (1998) never truly existed in its purported form. Instead, it was a highly sophisticated, clandestine project initiated in 2018.

Our key player: Rufus Sewell. We posit that after his role in "The Man in the High Castle," he became a subject of intense interest for a shadowy, technologically advanced organization.

The Korean Lab:
A secret lab, hidden deep within South Korea, became the epicenter of this project. Leveraging cutting-edge de-aging technology and advanced memory manipulation techniques, they sought to create a cinematic experience that blurred the lines between reality and fiction.

Memory Confabulation:
John Murdoch's amnesia is not merely a plot device, but a reflection of the film's production process. Sewell's memories were systematically altered, creating a sense of disorientation and uncertainty. The film's narrative mirrors this process, with Murdoch's fragmented memories representing the manipulated recollections of the actor himself.
The film itself is a demonstration of how easily memories can be implanted.

De-Aging and Reality Distortion:
The lab's de-aging technology was used to revert Sewell to his 1998 appearance, creating the illusion of a film made decades prior.

The perpetual night of dark city is a product of advanced cgi, that was so ahead of its time, that it could not be detected.

The "Strangers" as Metaphor:
The "Strangers" themselves become a metaphor for the clandestine organization behind the film, manipulating reality and controlling the narrative from the shadows.

The Purpose:
The purpose of this elaborate deception? To test the limits of memory manipulation and reality distortion, to explore the power of suggestion and the malleability of human perception. Or, perhaps, to subtly introduce subliminal messages into the collective consciousness, influencing societal trends and political agendas.

The "Evidence":

"Anomalies" in the film's production history, inconsistencies in archival footage, and the uncanny realism of the special effects are cited as "evidence" of this conspiracy.

The fact that the film gained a cult following, and was not a large box office success, is used as proof that it was not a mainstream film from 1998.
