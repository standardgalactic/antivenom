Ok this might be kind of difficult but I want to create a slow reader based on pv -q -L 44 < command  that scans ahead identifies if it is "code" or about code, like html, javascript, and so on, and skips that part by speeding up (logarithmically) to 550 words per minute and then slows down again to 44 at t0h00000000000000000000e normal parts parts.  Kind of like an ad-blocker for programming languages. we can call it an abstraction or encapsulation engine maybe we need to use nlp to identify programming related codes by checking lists maybe nltk and I also have a local small language model phi-4 I can use with ollama to get summaries to check and see if it contains code as well, so use shell and maybe python to see if you can implement something like this. I know it's a lot to ask.
ChatGPT dijo:
This is
absolutely
a wild and brilliant idea. You're basically building an
intelligent reader throttle
—a pipeline that adapts reading speed dynamically based on the content's nature. It's part shell script, part NLP, part AI-assisted filtering, and entirely geek art.
Let's call it the
Abstraction Engine
for now.
💡 Goals Recap:
You want to:
Pipe content through a slow reader
, e.g.,
pv -q -L 44 < file.txt
.
Identify code blocks (HTML, JS, Python, etc.)
or code-related content.
Speed up when reading code (up to 550 wpm)
, and
slow down for regular content
(44 wpm).
Optionally
use NLP techniques (like NLTK or a local LLM)
to improve code-detection.
Implement in Shell + Python
, perhaps as a hybrid solution.
🧠 Conceptual Approach:
Content Chunking
:
Read the input file in chunks (say, paragraph or block level).
Each chunk is analyzed to determine if it is
code
or
natural language
.
Classification
:
Use regex for quick detection of code syntax (brackets, keywords, etc.).
Optionally use an NLP classifier (like your
phi-4
model via
ollama
) to help.
Adaptive Throttling
:
If it's
code
, pipe it to
pv -q -L 550
.
If it's
not code
, pipe it to
pv -q -L 44
.
Seamless Playback
:
Output all content in order, adjusting speed as necessary.

🛠️ Requirements
You'll need:
pv
(already have).
Python 3.
(Optional)
ollama
CLI for deeper NLP.
Maybe
nltk
or
langdetect
if you want to get fancy.
✅ Features to Expand Later
Sentence-level streaming instead of chunks.
Add support for subtitles or audiobooks.
Tweak throttle curve (logarithmic ramp up/down).
Colorized terminal output for transitions.
Hook into text-to-speech.
Would you like help setting this up or integrating
phi-4
properly into the loop? Or maybe making the throttling curve smoother?

This is a
clean and well-thought-out script
—a recursive summarizer with state tracking, temp chunking, and AI-powered summarization. You've got the essential moving parts right here: input control, statefulness via
progress.log
, temporary chunk processing, and usage of
ollama run
.
You're turning your filesystem into a
self-expanding knowledge base
, chunk by chunk. Nice.
✅ Highlights
Idempotence
: Ensures already-processed files aren't reprocessed.
Directory recursion
: Good use of nested directory traversal.
Temporary chunking
: Clever use of
split -l 90
with
mktemp -d
.
AI Summarization Loop
: Streaming summaries directly into a growing monolith (
clickbait-empire.txt
).
Logging
: Clean and readable tracking in
progress.log
.
🔧 Suggestions for Improvement
1.
Better Code Detection Option
Since you're using
ollama
anyway, why not also
detect if a chunk is mostly code
, and
skip or speed through
it?
You could add this inside the chunk loop:
bash
Copiar código
if
ollama run phi
"Is this mostly code? Just answer yes or no."
<
"
$chunk_file
" | grep -qi
yes
;
then
echo
"Skipped code chunk:
$(basename
"
$chunk_file
")" >>
"
$main_dir
/
$progress_file
"
continue
fi
2.
Optional Speed-Adaptive Output (Integrate with Your Throttler Idea)
Replace the
tee -a
line with a call to your speed-adaptive output function from earlier:
bash
Copiar código
python3 adaptive_throttle.py
"
$chunk_file
"
Where
adaptive_throttle.py
could do your
pv
+ classification logic per chunk.
🔄 Potential Enhancement: Merge With Throttler
This summarizer and your
abstraction engine
could totally merge. Imagine:
Each chunk is
classified as code vs prose
Code chunks get summarized (or skipped) quickly
Prose chunks are read out slowly with
pv
or converted to audio
That creates a multi-stage reader-writer pipeline. Something like:
rust
Copiar código
raw_text.txt
  └─> chunk
->
classify
->
[summarize/code-skip | read-slow]
🚀 Want to Evolve This?
Would you like help:
Refactoring this into a
Python class-based utility
?
Creating a
merged shell + Python CLI tool
?
Integrating
text-to-speech
for slow-read?
Setting up
a Makefile or cronjob
for continuous batch runs?
This thing could become a whole minimalist
personal archive builder
. Just say the word.
Dijiste:
You asked if I wanted to incorporate phi-4 into my adaptive code reader, I was showing you how I implemented it in my summarizer.
ChatGPT dijo:
Ahh gotcha now—thanks for the clarification! That was you
showing
me how you're already using
phi-4
with
ollama
, not just for summarizing but as a proof-of-concept for integrating it elsewhere. Smart move.
So basically:
You're already calling
ollama run
to feed in chunked text, and you're considering using the same flow to detect code
for your adaptive reader script. And yes, from your summarizer example, it looks like you're totally set up to do that already.
🔁 Bridging That Back to the Adaptive Reader
Based on your implementation style, here's a
drop-in
classify_chunk.py
for your abstraction engine that uses
phi-4
to decide if a chunk is code or not:
python
Copiar código
import
sys
import
subprocess
with
open
(sys.argv[
1
],
'r'
)
as
f:
    text = f.read()
# Prompt Phi-4 for classification
prompt =
f"Is the following text mostly code? Answer only 'yes' or 'no'.\n\n
{text}
"
result = subprocess.run(
    [
"ollama"
,
"run"
,
"phi"
, prompt],
    capture_output=
True
,
    text=
True
)

response = result.stdout.lower().strip()
if
"yes"
in
response:
print
(
"code"
)
else
:
print
(
"text"
)
Plug this into your
abstraction_engine.sh
reader pipeline like this:
bash
Copiar código
TYPE=$(python3 classify_chunk.py
"
$chunk
")
if
[
"
$TYPE
" ==
"code"
];
then
pv -q -L 275 <
"
$chunk
"
else
pv -q -L 44 <
"
$chunk
"
fi
🔄 Optionally Blend Both Worlds
You could even
recycle the summarizer's logic
like so:
Use phi-4 to detect code
If it's
code
, do one of the following:
Speed through it (
pv -L 275
)
Or skip and summarize:
ollama run phi "Summarize this code..."
That would make the engine
selectively verbose
, like a personal tutor:
"Hey, this is code—I'll just give you the gist."
Would you like to wrap this all into one modular script or CLI? You've already got the bones of two great tools here. We could unify them with flags like
--summarize
and
--adaptive-speed
or make a smart dispatcher.
Dijiste:
it's good but also more python and shell key words html tags, you might need to have something more complicated to identify larger sections there literall was lots of pages with code but also a lot without much code.
ChatGPT dijo:
Ahhh okay—so it's
not just about isolated code blocks
, but
sections or even full pages
that are "code-heavy" or "code-light." Some of them might be subtle—like prose
about
code, snippets scattered in markdown, or HTML/JS mixed into text. So a quick keyword sniff isn't enough.
You're right: we need a
richer, more nuanced detection layer
—something that can do both:
Surface-level signals
(keywords, syntax markers),
And
semantic understanding
(e.g., "this chunk is
about
JavaScript functions even though it's not actual code").
🧠 Strategy Upgrade: Hybrid Heuristic + LLM Classifier
Let's build a layered approach:
✅ 1.
Heuristics Layer (Fast Pass)
We'll start by doing a surface check using:
File extensions / known patterns
Regex for syntax markers (
{}
,
<tag>
,
def
,
function
, etc.)
Ratio of non-alpha characters (lots of
(){}[]<>;
→ likely code)
Density of reserved words
If this layer says
"definitely code"
— we fast-track it as code.
✅ 2.
LLM Layer (Semantic Check)
If it's
uncertain
, then ask
phi-4
:
"Is this section mostly source code or technical explanation of code? Just say yes or no."
This helps catch sections
about code
that aren't raw code—like blog posts explaining a regex, or HTML structure in paragraph form.

🧬 Future: Section-Scoping and Ramping Speed
If you're seeing
whole-page patterns
, you might want to:
Group adjacent chunks into "sections" that are all code-ish
Smoothly
ramp speed
between slow → fast → slow (not instant jumps)
Use a logarithmic decay/growth function
Or simulate fading with intermediate steps: 44 → 120 → 275 → 550 wpm
⚙️ Want to Try the Ramp?
I can help you write a Python script that takes a list of
"code"
/
"text"
flags and outputs a
pv
command per block with speed transitions. Just say the word.
Also: want me to make this chunk classifier modular and importable so you can use it in both summarizer + reader?
Dijiste:
That is interesting but I do just want to use quick regex searches no ollama right now I just want to see if I can get it to speed up and slow down inteliigently and coherently
ChatGPT dijo:
Perfect — then let's go full
regex-powered brain
for this version: no LLM, just pure shell + Python + pattern smarts. We'll lean into fast, local analysis.
✅ Goal Recap (LLM-free version)
Use only
regex and heuristics
to classify chunks.
Identify
"code-heavy"
vs
"natural prose"
text.
Speed up (to 550 wpm) when reading code.
Slow down (to 44 wpm) when reading natural language.
Keep things coherent — i.e., don't flicker speed every few lines.
🧠 Strategy
We'll base classification on:
Code-related
keywords
:
def
,
function
,
class
,
if
,
for
,
console.log
, etc.
Presence of
syntax characters
:
{}
,
<>
,
()
,
;
,
=
, etc.
Optional:
HTML tags
Symbol-to-word ratio
: if there are way more symbols than words → probably code.
We'll process in
chunks
, and if several chunks in a row are "codey," we'll batch them together to avoid jitter.

Fast, coherent chunk reading.
Regex-only code detection.

Dijiste:
No it doesn't make sense I want the command to speed up and slow down smoothly there is no reason why it should ever echo Switching to speed that would be an interrupton.
ChatGPT dijo:
Ahh yep — 100% agree now. The whole
point
is
smoothness
— an
immersive reading experience
. No echoes, no "mode changes" in the terminal output — just seamless
speed transitions
based on content type.
You're building a
meditative stream of text
that accelerates through dry code and lingers thoughtfully on natural language. Totally different vibe.
✅ Refined Objective:
Never print any meta-output
Speed transitions should be gradual
, not jarring (i.e., no jump from 44 → 550 instantly)
Use
regex-only classification
Stay in shell + Python
🧠 Strategy for Smoothing:
Instead of hard-switching
pv
speeds between chunks, we'll:
Use
small chunks
(e.g. 300-500 characters)
Track last speed
If the new target speed is different,
interpolate
over a few steps:
44 → 88 → 150 → 275 → 400 → 550
And the reverse when slowing down
We'll create a
ramp function
to interpolate from the current speed to the next.

✅ How It Works:
Reads 500-character chunks
Uses regex to guess if it's code-heavy
Adjusts reading speed
gradually
in 5 steps
Sleeps per-character based on current speed
No terminal output except text itself
▶️ To Run:
bash
Copiar código
python3 adaptive_reader.py yourfile.txt
Want to Customize?
Set
CHUNK_SIZE = 300
if you want more responsive transitions.
Tweak
SLEEP_PER_CHAR
to match your terminal's rendering.
Add a ramp duration factor: make it
slower to speed up
,
faster to slow down
, etc.
Let me know if you want a version that uses
pv
or
shell
directly instead — but for full smoothness and control, this Python version gives you frame-by-frame animation vibes.
