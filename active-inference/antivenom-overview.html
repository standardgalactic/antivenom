<p>The research discussed here presents a comprehensive mathematical
framework for understanding agency, learning, and exploration from a
geometric and dissipative perspective. This framework is built upon
three main principles: universal induction (favoring the simplest
explanation), active inference (acting to minimize predictive errors),
and emergent agency (complex behaviors arising from simple systems).</p>
<p>At the core of this model is the concept of surprise minimization,
where surprise is defined as the expected negative log evidence of
sensory outcomes. The agent’s goal is to minimize instantaneous
moment-to-moment sensory surprise, leading to a primary drive for
simplicity and predictability. However, the real challenge arises from
the darkroom paradox: an optimal strategy for minimizing surprise is not
constant action but retreating into a perfectly passive, predictable
environment where no learning or exploration occurs.</p>
<p>To address this problem, the researchers propose a
complexity-weighted surprise minimization model using variational field
theory and partial differential equations (PDEs). This approach enables
proving universal truths about agency that discrete models like cellular
automata cannot. The key fields in this model are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>ZeloDollar (surprise field): A scalar field representing the
intensity of predictive surprise at every point in space and time.</li>
<li>VLTT (action field): A vector field representing the agent’s policy
or action, which steers its sensory observations.</li>
<li>Complexity density: A term that ensures the preferred low-surprise
state is also a simple one by imposing an exponential bias toward
hypotheses with minimal Kolmogorov complexity.</li>
</ol>
<p>These fields are bundled into an energy functional (E-tests) that the
agent aims to minimize, which includes costs for surprise, complexity,
and action. The system evolves over time via a gradient flow governed by
coupled nonlinear PDEs, leading to a decaying policy (action collapse)
and flattening of the predictive landscape (surprise field).</p>
<p>The mathematical rigor is reinforced through existence and uniqueness
proofs for the solutions, using tools like Lyapunov stability results.
The model reveals that agency is inherently transient due to the
exponential decay of action and the geometric flattening of uncertainty.
This collapse is unavoidable unless an external force (e.g., a
complexity density parameter) maintains non-equilibrium conditions,
allowing for persistent exploration and learning.</p>
<p>Two key interpretations emerge from this model:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Play as simulated danger: Exploration is voluntarily increasing
predictive curvature in small areas to gain information, which later
leads to robust, low-complexity models and reduced overall surprise.
This behavior is mathematically guaranteed to be reversible and
bounded.</li>
<li>Learning as inoculation against surprise: The total exposure to
informational deviation over an agent’s lifetime is finite due to the
exponential decay of predictive curvature components. This learning
process acts as a controlled introduction of uncertainty, allowing the
agent to build immunity against future surprises within that domain once
it has mastered them.</li>
</ol>
<p>The research also discusses potential extensions and future
directions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Connecting algorithmic information theory with physical geometry to
understand how computational complexity translates into geometric
density in predictive manifolds.</li>
<li>Extending the model to stochastic PDEs, incorporating real-world
noise that can drive exploration.</li>
<li>Improving policy modeling by introducing explicit control
constraints and complex couplings between surprise and action
fields.</li>
<li>Exploring external forces or continuous influxes of unpredictable
data from dynamic environments to sustain epistemic curvature and
achieve persistent activity.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ultimately, this research suggests that true, non-transient agency
requires a structurally stable mechanism designed to counteract the
universe’s natural tendency toward informational flatness and maximal
predictability. This framework fundamentally alters our understanding of
agency, viewing it as geometric, dissipative, and finite—a controlled
deviation into risky regimes with guaranteed safe returns, driven by the
race against informational entropy.</p>
<p>In this research presentation, Mikuel Vanucci is discussing a study
on a type of agent that minimizes surprise under the Free Energy
Principle. The research is conducted at V University in Amsterdam with
his supervisor Peter Bloom. Here’s a detailed summary and
explanation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Background and Motivation</strong>: Initially, the
research focused on placing a discrete model (cellular automata) within
a reinforcement learning feedback loop, guided by free energy-related
principles. However, they pivoted to a different approach using Turing
Machines as models of the environment. This change allows for a discrete
model class and aligns with the Free Energy Principle’s surprise
minimization aspect.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Free Energy Principle Connection</strong>: The agent is
assumed to have perfect Bayesian inference capabilities, allowing it to
calculate a perfect posterior over possible environmental models. This
perfect inference enables decomposing free energy into two components:
free energy term and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the
agent’s posterior and true posterior. Minimizing this KL divergence
equates to minimizing surprise, as it leaves only surprise when the
divergence is zero.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Solomonoff Predictor</strong>: The agent uses the
Solomonoff predictor for predicting the next observation. This predictor
combines all possible models weighted by their posterior probability,
where simpler models receive higher prior probabilities due to Occam’s
Razor principle. It considers computable environments, assuming there
exists a program that can simulate the environment – a weak assumption
consistent with artificial intelligence principles.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Previous Work - Knowledge Seeking Agent</strong>:
Previous research on knowledge-seeking agents maximizes information gain
or surprise to learn the true environment. However, these agents face
issues like potentially fatal actions due to their exploratory nature
and over-optimism.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proposed Approach - Surprise Minimization</strong>: The
proposed agent aims to minimize surprise instead of maximizing it. This
is inspired by free energy literature in reinforcement learning, which
hasn’t been extensively explored yet. Under this approach:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Reward is defined as the negative log probability of predicting
the next observation (or including action uncertainty).</p></li>
<li><p>The value function becomes expected surprise over future
trajectories. This can be decomposed into information gain and risk,
where the risk term is zero for deterministic environments.</p></li>
<li><p>The agent tries to maintain consistency between new observations
and existing models, prioritizing simpler environments due to their
higher prior probability (exponential prior).</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Niche Definition</strong>: A niche is defined as an
environment with lower complexity than the true one but still capable of
generating the same observations under a given policy. The agent tends
to stay within these niches, exploring less and focusing on maintaining
consistency with simpler environments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Limitations &amp; Future Work</strong>: The agent’s
behavior might seem unintelligent at times (e.g., circling in a ‘dark
room’ environment), but this could be seen as a form of
self-preservation if the environment contains potential dangers. To
encourage exploration, one could adjust the prior to favor more complex
environments, but this might also lead the agent to find simpler niches
within those complex environments.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, this research explores an alternative approach to
reinforcement learning by focusing on surprise minimization instead of
maximization, using Turing Machines as environmental models and the
Solomonoff Predictor for predictions. The work highlights potential
issues like unintelligent behavior in certain environments and suggests
avenues for future exploration, such as adjusting priors to balance
exploration and exploitation.</p>
<p>The discussion revolves around Mikuela’s presentation on linking
Solomon Offord (Solomon) Induction with the Free Energy Principle. The
conversation touches upon several aspects, primarily focusing on
understanding how these two seemingly distinct theories can be
connected.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Approximate Posterior and True Posterior</strong>:
There’s a query about equating the approximate posterior with the true
posterior, especially given Mikuela’s interest in Free Energy bounds and
estimations, which typically involve Variational Inference (VI). The
speaker explains that in this context, there’s no need for VI since
computational constraints aren’t an issue. Instead, the Solomon
predictor is used to calculate surprise directly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Surprise Minimization</strong>: There’s confusion about
what constitutes ‘surprise’ in Mikuela’s formulation versus the Free
Energy Principle. The speaker suggests that Mikuela might be conflating
prediction error (predicted posterior given history) with surprise
(negative log probability of an outcome). In the Free Energy Principle,
surprise refers to the likelihood of a burning or harmful event, not
prediction accuracy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dark Room Problem</strong>: The speaker proposes that
resolving the ‘dark room’ problem—where the agent gets stuck in simple
environments—might involve a blend of surprise minimization and
information gain. They suggest that incorporating both could prevent the
agent from getting trapped in simplistic niches while still encouraging
exploration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Free Energy Principle and Solomon Induction</strong>: The
primary suggestion is for Mikuela to establish a formal link between
these two principles, acknowledging their fundamental differences. While
Solomon Induction starts with algorithmic complexity and unlimited
resources, the Free Energy Principle originates from continuous state
spaces and random fluctuations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Information Gain vs Surprise Minimization</strong>: The
speaker argues that both information gain (from knowledge seeking) and
surprise minimization are crucial. Overemphasizing one over the other
could lead to issues like the dark room problem or uncontrolled
exploration, respectively.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expected Free Energy</strong>: The speaker recommends
reinterpreting Mikuela’s ‘expected surprise’ as the ‘expected free
energy,’ which consists of expected information gain (intrinsic
motivation) and an ‘expected cost’ or ‘expected surprise’ (penalty for
harmful outcomes). This interpretation aligns more closely with the Free
Energy Principle.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Relevant Literature</strong>: The speaker provides two
key papers to consider: one deriving expected free energy from first
principles in continuous state spaces, and another connecting
variational free energy minimization with algorithmic complexity and
compression. These resources might help Mikuela better understand the
Free Energy Principle and identify similarities between it and her work
on Solomon Induction.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In essence, the discussion encourages a deeper exploration of how the
principles of Solomon Induction (focusing on algorithmic complexity) and
the Free Energy Principle (centered around continuous state spaces and
random fluctuations) can be reconciled or linked, potentially offering
new insights into intrinsic motivation and knowledge acquisition in
artificial agents.</p>
<p>The conversation appears to be a discussion between two individuals
(presumably researchers or scholars) about a complex topic related to
machine learning, information theory, and decision-making under
uncertainty, possibly within the framework of Active Inference or
related theories. Here’s a breakdown of the key points:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Information Gain and Mutual Information</strong>: The
speaker introduces the concept of information gain as the expected
reduction in uncertainty about the states of the world given some
observations. This is equivalent to mutual information, which measures
the amount of information that observing one random variable provides
about another.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maximizing Information Gain</strong>: Contrary to what
might initially seem intuitive (minimizing uncertainty), the speaker
argues that in this context, information gain should be maximized. This
is because, in decision-making under uncertainty, an agent aims to
gather as much information as possible to make better
decisions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>KL Divergence and Sign Change</strong>: The
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, a measure of how one probability
distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution,
is used to quantify the difference between the states of the world under
different policies and the agent’s preferred or “rewarding” states.
Initially presented as a minimization problem, when interpreted in terms
of random variables (future outcomes), it becomes a maximization problem
due to the nature of KL divergence.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Surprise as Reward</strong>: The concept of ‘surprise’ is
introduced as a measure of unexpectedness or novelty in an agent’s
experience. This surprise, when it occurs, acts as a reward that
motivates the agent to explore and gather more information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Solomonoff Predictor and Posterior Predicted
Density</strong>: The Solomonoff predictor is mentioned as a theoretical
construct for predicting future outcomes. The posterior predicted
density refers to the distribution of possible observations given
certain cues or prior knowledge, which can be used to relax constraints
in decision-making.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Algorithmic Complexity</strong>: There’s a reference to
algorithmic complexity, suggesting that this concept might play a role
in the theoretical framework being discussed, possibly related to how
much computational resources (or ‘complexity’) are required to make
predictions or decisions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Future Work and Collaboration</strong>: The conversation
concludes with suggestions for further reading and potential future
collaboration on deriving bounds and inequalities relevant to Expected
Free Energy (a key concept in Active Inference) and knowledge-seeking
behavior under constraints.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This summary is based on the assumption that the dialogue is
discussing theoretical concepts within machine learning or artificial
intelligence, as the specific technical terms and jargon suggest. The
exact details might vary depending on the precise context of the
conversation (e.g., a research seminar, a workshop discussion,
etc.).</p>
<p>Michele Vannucci, a student at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,
proposes a thesis on studying the emergence of agency within complex
adaptive systems (CAS), specifically focusing on cellular automata (CA)
within the Free Energy Principle (FEP) framework.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Introduction</strong>: The research aims to investigate
minimal (chaotic) CAS that display adaptive behavior in their
environment, while highlighting connections between machine learning,
free energy, chaos theory, and self-organization. Vannucci hypothesizes
that the exact definition of the complex system or perception-action
interface does not significantly impact the emergence of a minimal form
of agency, as long as they possess certain properties (e.g., mixing
properties for the system).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Passive vs Active Inference</strong>: Vannucci discusses
the limitations of passive generative models in understanding
intelligent behavior and supports the use of active inference, which
involves an agent’s model interacting with its environment through a
feedback loop. This aligns with the enactivist viewpoint that highlights
the importance of building grounded generative models of the environment
and hidden states for an agent to exhibit intelligent behavior.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Free Energy Principle (FEP)</strong>: Vannucci
outlines FEP’s potential in modeling an agent’s reward-seeking and
adaptive behavior by minimizing surprise on sensory inputs, which is
equivalent to performing a gradient ascent on Value (defined by the
Bellman equation). This principle also entails that minimization of
surprise over sensory states leads to the generation of meaningful
internal representations/states of hidden causes in an optimal
Bayes-optimal manner.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Self-organization and Markov Blanket</strong>: The link
between free energy minimization and self-organization (autopoiesis) is
reinforced by entropy and energy minimization, as well as self-evidence
maximization. A steady-state non-equilibrium system isolated by a Markov
blanket from its environment will minimize free energy over time. The
blanket creates causal separation between internal and external states,
leading to the emergence of active states encoding posterior beliefs
about hidden (external) states under given generative models.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Computational Implementation</strong>: Vannucci plans to
simulate an artificial agent that minimizes free energy using complex
adaptive systems such as generalized cellular automata. Ergodic and
mixing properties of these CA have been outlined in literature, and they
can exhibit emergence and self-organization like Conway’s Game of Life
or sensorimotor agency in Lenia continuous-state CAs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Example Experiments</strong>: Vannucci proposes two types
of experiments:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><strong>Numerical Simulations</strong>:
<ul>
<li>A two-armed bandit experiment using chaotic and Turing-complete
mono-dimensional CA (e.g., Rule 110) to model an agent in a multi-armed
bandit setting with hidden causes, and analyze the emergence of adaptive
behavior by calculating variational free energy.</li>
<li>More experiments involving multiple arms or modeling each arm as a
Markup Decision Process state with stochastic transitions can be
conducted to assess the agent’s policy and internal state
trajectories.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mathematical Approach</strong>: Studying the evolution of
complex systems like cellular automata using mathematical formalism,
focusing on the properties of rules that yield stable attractors
coinciding with an optimum on free energy and policy.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Vannucci argues that chaotic
systems, specifically cellular automata, are fascinating for studying
self-organization and emergence of properties like agency or
intelligence. Despite existing research highlighting CA’s “learning”
capabilities and their role in open-ended evolution, there is little
exploration at the intersection of FEP, Reinforcement Learning,
Self-organization, and Complex Systems. Vannucci hopes that this study
will fill this gap by investigating how CAS can give rise to emergent
properties under the FEP framework.</p></li>

<p>Unidimary numbers are a positional numeral system based on a
non-integer base, specifically b = 3/2. Despite using fractional powers
of the base, every nonnegative integer can be represented uniquely with
digits from {0, 1, 2}. The representation is generated through an
“exploding dots” or 3→2 box rule:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Start with an infinite row of boxes extending to the left.</li>
<li>Place dots in each box according to the number you want to represent
(rightmost box for the units place).</li>
<li>Whenever a box contains 3 dots, remove those 3 dots and add 2 dots
to the next box on the left.</li>
<li>Repeat this process until every box has at most 2 dots.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule works because each explosion (3 dots becoming 2 in the next
box) preserves the value of the number due to the relationship: 3 *
(3/2)^k = 2 * (3/2)^(k+1). This means that, despite intermediate steps
involving fractions, the final result will always be an integer.</p>
<p>Unidimary numbers are a special case of β-expansions, where numbers
are represented in non-integer bases β &gt; 1. The base 3/2 is unique
because it allows every integer to have a finite representation using
only digits {0, 1, 2}. This property isn’t generally true for other β
values.</p>
<p>The exploding box rule can be linked conceptually to various themes
in RSVP (Reversible Symbolic Voronoi Pseudodynamics) and lamphrodynamic
field theory:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Nonlinear flow with a preserved quantity: The 3→2 rule defines a
dynamics that preserves total value, similar to lamphrodynamic flows
which preserve an information-like invariant while redistributing
structure.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiscale recursion: Each step in the exploding box rule
multiplies by (3/2), creating a recursive multi-scale decomposition
analogous to semantic recursion in TARTAN or lamphrodynamic
scaling.</p></li>
<li><p>Complexity minimization: Explosions stabilize digits into {0, 1,
2}, compressing large integers into stable symbolic forms, resembling
curvature-minimizing flows.</p></li>
<li><p>Discrete/Continuous Correspondence: The exploding box picture is
discrete and combinatorial, while the analytic expansion uses continuous
fractional powers. Their equivalence mirrors discrete PDE approximations
and CA/PDE correspondences in RSVP models.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Future research directions include exploring fractional unidimary
expansions (analogues of decimal points), developing multiplication and
division algorithms, investigating connections with golden-base
arithmetics, and applying beta-shift symbolic dynamics in ergodic
theory.</p>
<p>Title: Unidinary Numbers and the Base 3/2 System: Exploding Dots, The
3 →2 Box, Decimal Interpretation, Beta Expansions, Arithmetic, and
Conceptual Connections</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Introduction:
<ul>
<li>Unidinary numbers are a positional numeral system based on the
non-integer base of 3/2 (often referred to as “base one and a half”).
Despite being unconventional, this system demonstrates intriguing
connections with combinatorics, number representation, symmetry, beta
expansions, and computational models like exploding dots.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What Are Unidinary Numbers?
<ul>
<li>In traditional positional notation, an integer base ‘b’ is chosen to
represent every non-negative integer N as a sum of digits multiplied by
powers of ‘b’, where the digits are integers from 0 to b-1. For
unidinary numbers, the base is b = 3/2, and the allowable digits are
restricted to {0, 1, 2}.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The 3 →2 Exploding Box Rule:
<ul>
<li>This rule offers an intuitive method for generating unidinary
representations. It involves an infinite row of boxes filled from right
to left with dots representing an integer N. Whenever a box contains
three dots, those three dots “explode,” removing them and adding two new
dots to the adjacent box on the left. This process continues until every
box has at most two dots.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Powers of 3/2:
<ul>
<li>The sequence of powers for base 3/2 starts as follows: (3/2)^0 = 1,
(3/2)^1 = 1.5, (3/2)^2 = 2.25, and so on.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Examples: Representing Numbers in Base 3/2
<ul>
<li>Example 1: The number 10 is represented as (2101)3/2 because
2<em>(3.375) + 1</em>(2.25) + 0<em>(1.5) + 1</em>0 = 10.</li>
<li>Example 2: The number 14 is represented as (2122)3/2 since
2<em>(3.375) + 1</em>(2.25) + 2<em>(1.5) + 2</em>0 = 14.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Decimal Interpretation and Integer Preservation:
<ul>
<li>Each digit in the unidinary representation is multiplied by
fractional powers of (3/2), but due to the 3 →2 rule, the sum always
results in an integer. This maintains the total value, ensuring that no
information is lost during conversion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Another Example: (2120)3/2 = 12
<ul>
<li>(2120)3/2 = 2<em>(3.375) + 1</em>(2.25) + 2*(1.5) = 12,
demonstrating the equivalence between unidinary and decimal
representations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Arithmetic in Unidimary Notation:
<ul>
<li>Addition in base 3/2 follows similar rules to those used in other
bases; explosions occur whenever a digit reaches three, triggering the
addition of new dots and shifting existing ones to the left.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Beta Expansions and Irrational Bases:
<ul>
<li>The unidinary system is part of a broader theory known as
β-expansions, which represents numbers using non-integer bases (e.g.,
base φ or golden ratio). These systems connect discrete representations
with continuous phenomena, symbolic dynamics, and number theory.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Conceptual Connections to RSVP and Field Theory:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Although derived from a simple combinatorial rule, unidinary numbers
exhibit various themes found in the RSVP (Reactive-Stochastic Vector
Process) framework and lamphrodynamic field theory:
<ul>
<li>Nonlinear flow preserving total value. The 3 →2 explosions maintain
the overall sum while redistributing structure, similar to
lamphrodynamic flows that preserve an information-like invariant.</li>
<li>Multiscale recursion. Each box leftward represents a recursive
multi-scale decomposition, analogous to semantic recursion in TARTAN or
lamphrodynamic scaling.</li>
<li>Complexity minimization. Explosions reduce digits to {0, 1, 2},
effectively compressing large integers into stable symbolic
forms—reminiscent of curvature-minimizing flows.</li>
<li>Discrete/Continuous Correspondence. The exploding-box picture is
discrete and combinatorial, while the analytic expansion uses continuous
fractional powers, mirroring the relationship between discrete PDE
approximations and CA (Cellular Automata)/PDE correspondences in RSVP
models.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The document also includes appendices with a lookup table for
converting numbers from 0-20 into base 3/2 and a Python conversion
script to facilitate understanding and working with unidinary
numbers.</p>
<p>Title: Complexity-Weighted Surprise Minimization as a Variational
Field Theory</p>
<p>This paper presents a mathematical framework for understanding how
predictive systems can exhibit transient agent-like behavior through
surprise minimization, with a focus on complexity-weighted beliefs. The
authors develop a continuous formulation using functional analysis and
partial differential equations (PDEs). Here’s a detailed summary of the
key aspects:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Modeling Predictive Uncertainty</strong>: Surprise is
represented as a scalar field S(x,t) that measures predictive
uncertainty across a spatial domain X at time t. The total surprise F[S]
is defined by integrating S weighted by a complexity density
K(x,t).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action Representation</strong>: Actions are modeled as a
vector field v(x,t), which steers future observations through an
abstract predictive dynamics ∂tot = v(ot, t).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Energy Functional and Variational Principle</strong>: The
central energy functional E[S,v] combines F[S], representing the
complexity-weighted surprise, and G[v], penalizing large policy
displacements. The authors derive a variational principle that governs
the system’s dynamics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)</strong>: The
Euler-Lagrange equations of this variational problem lead to coupled
nonlinear PDEs for S(x,t) and v(x,t):</p>
<ul>
<li>∂tS = -1 + α∆S, the evolution equation for surprise.</li>
<li>∂tv = -v, governing the policy field’s decay towards zero.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Existence and Uniqueness</strong>: The authors prove
existence of weak solutions in Sobolev spaces and uniqueness under
certain conditions. They show that steady-state solutions minimize an
information-geometric energy functional.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Time Behavior</strong>: The system’s long-term
behavior is characterized by convergence to a minimal-complexity
equilibrium where surprise is uniformly distributed across space,
leading to zero policy displacements (a “dark-room” state). This
collapse into simplicity is irreversible due to the PDE’s dissipative
nature.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exploration and Agency</strong>: The model explains how
exploration emerges in non-equilibrium regimes as a result of temporary
increases in predictive curvature (surprise gradients). This insight
resolves an apparent duality between stability and exploratory behavior,
both being aspects of the same variational principle.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Topological Interpretation</strong>: The steady states’
degeneracy is linked to the topology of the spatial domain X. Different
domains can support different minimal-curvature equilibria, leading to a
topological moduli space of “dark room” solutions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Connections to Discrete Models</strong>: This continuous
formulation provides a geometric interpretation for concepts studied in
discrete cellular automata models of emergent agency. It highlights the
mathematical structure underlying agent-like behavior in both continuum
and discrete approaches.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, this work offers a mathematically rigorous foundation for
understanding how surprise minimization can generate transient agency
within predictive systems. By formulating surprise minimization as a
continuous field theory, it uncovers key insights into the dynamics of
exploration, policy collapse, and the interplay between uncertainty
reduction and agent-like behavior, while connecting these principles to
broader discussions in information geometry, variational inference, and
statistical physics.</p>
<p>This text discusses a mathematical framework that connects
Generalized Cellular Automata (GCA) and Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs) to study the emergence of agency, or self-directed action, in
systems. The core idea is that surprise minimization—the tendency of a
system to reduce predictive errors—can give rise to transient agency
without needing external control mechanisms.</p>
<h3 id="key-concepts">Key Concepts:</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Surprise Minimization</strong>: The fundamental principle
here is the reduction of surprise, or prediction error. This is
represented by a local-to-global mechanism where informative deviations
are amplified before being eliminated.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Local Cell State and Surprise Field</strong>: In GCA,
each cell (or node) has a state variable that evolves based on its
neighbors’ states. The PDE formulation replaces these discrete cells
with a continuous surprise field S(x, t), where x represents spatial
coordinates and t represents time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Perception-Action Loop</strong>: Both GCA and the PDE
model feature a perception-action loop. In GCA, this is represented by
updates to both the internal state (St+1) and action variable (vt+1)
based on neighborhood information. The PDE version describes how the
surprise field (S) influences an associated vector field (v), which
represents actions or responses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Emergent Agency</strong>: In both models, agency emerges
as a transient phenomenon when epistemic curvature—gradients of the
surprise field—persist over time. When this curvature dissipates, the
system collapses into quiescent states with trivial action.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dark Room Phenomenon</strong>: This refers to situations
where local rules in CA eliminate heterogeneity and drive the system
toward homogeneous configurations (i.e., a “dark room” with no
distinguishable features). In PDE terms, this corresponds to convergence
towards the unique steady solution of ∆S = α−1 and v = 0.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mathematical Equivalence</strong>: Despite belonging to
different mathematical traditions (discrete vs continuous), GCA and PDE
models share common behaviors due to their shared principle of surprise
minimization.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="numerical-implementation">Numerical Implementation:</h3>
<p>The text also sketches out methods for numerically simulating these
systems, including discretizing the domain using a uniform grid and
implementing explicit or semi-implicit schemes for updating the state
fields (S). It suggests various experiments to illustrate key phenomena
such as curvature collapse, metastable exploration, topologically
distinct dark rooms, and the impact of external forcing.</p>
<h3 id="philosophical-implications">Philosophical Implications:</h3>
<p>While the mathematical development itself is not normative, it
provides interpretations that are consistent with its structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploration arises from internal dynamics rather than being imposed
externally.</li>
<li>Agency is a transient feature under pure surprise minimization;
persistent agency requires additional epistemic driving forces.</li>
<li>Learning can be understood as controlled exposure to “simulated
danger,” and subsequent curvature collapse represents a form of
inoculation against future surprises.</li>
</ul>
<p>These interpretations are grounded in the mathematical structure
revealed by the PDE formulation, without invoking teleological or
goal-directed explanations.</p>
<p>In essence, this work provides a mathematical lens through which to
understand how complex behaviors like self-direction and adaptation can
emerge from simple local rules driven by prediction error
minimization.</p>
<p>Title: Surprise Minimization, Solomonoff Induction, and Expected Free
Energy: A Formal Analysis with Curvature Dynamics, Variational Flow, and
Minimal-Complexity Niches</p>
<p>This paper presents a mathematical analysis of an AIXI-like agent
that replaces external reward signals with instantaneous sensory
surprise. Under perfect Bayesian inference and using the Solomonoff
prior, the free energy bound collapses to the true surprise, leading
policy optimization to minimize negative log-evidence. This theoretical
framework unifies universal induction (Hutter, 2005; Solomonoff, 1964)
with active inference (Friston, 2010; Parr and Friston, 2022).</p>
<p>However, this surprise-minimizing agent suffers from a “dark-room
phenomenon,” wherein it collapses into minimal-complexity niches,
avoiding exploratory behavior. The authors aim to provide a rigorous
mathematical treatment of this system, focusing on:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Variational characterization of the optimal policy: This involves
defining an energy functional that incorporates surprise and complexity
bias, leading to a set of variational equations for the agent’s
behavior.</p></li>
<li><p>Curvature-dissipation partial differential equation (PDE) analogy
with existence and uniqueness proofs: The authors introduce a
diffusion-like penalty term to model predictive curvature, resulting in
an elliptic PDE system that captures large-scale behavior and curvature
dynamics.</p></li>
<li><p>Gradient-flow interpretation in information geometry (Amari,
2016): By interpreting the PDE system as a gradient flow within
information geometry, the authors establish a connection between
surprise minimization and geometric optimization principles.</p></li>
<li><p>Existence proofs of minimal-complexity convergence: Using
standard parabolic theory and analytic semigroup estimates, the authors
prove that solutions to the PDE system converge to a unique steady state
representing minimal curvature (complete predictability) unless external
factors or complexity parameters intervene.</p></li>
<li><p>Variational decomposition of Expected Free Energy, revealing how
epistemic value counteracts collapse: The authors demonstrate that
incorporating an epistemic bonus into the energy functional allows for
more robust exploration and prevents the dark-room phenomenon by
providing incentives to avoid minimal complexity niches.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The paper also offers interpretations of key concepts, such as “play
as simulated danger” (transient epistemic exposure increasing curvature)
and “learning as inoculation against surprise” (long-term collapse of
curvature to near-zero). These insights follow from the geometry of
information spaces without requiring goals or teleology.</p>
<p>In summary, this paper combines techniques from variational calculus,
information geometry, Kolmogorov complexity, and dissipative PDEs to
provide a rigorous mathematical analysis of a surprise-minimizing agent
and its dark-room phenomenon. The authors’ work highlights the interplay
between exploration, curvature dynamics, and epistemic value in shaping
the behavior of autonomous agents within information spaces.</p>
<p>Title: The Code of Learning: Play, Danger, and Surprise</p>
<p>This essay delves into the paradox of an intelligent system’s
behavior when its primary goal is to minimize surprise. Instead of
concluding that such a system would retreat into a passive, unchanging
state (the “dark room”), it posits that this state is the logical
endpoint of successful learning. Two analogies are used to explain this
concept:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Play as Simulated Danger</strong>: This analogy likens
exploration in a surprise-minimizing system to a fire drill or sparring
in martial arts - controlled, managed exposure to uncertainty for the
purpose of preparation and skill development.</p>
<ul>
<li>Predictive uncertainty (or “danger”) refers to situations where the
system is unsure about future events.</li>
<li>“Play” represents the system’s voluntary engagement with these
uncertain states.</li>
<li>Exploration occurs because of predictive curvature, which is
unevenness in the system’s certainty landscape. The system intentionally
moves toward uncertainty to flatten this curve.</li>
</ul>
<p>This process serves three purposes: expanding predictability by
learning how the world behaves, safely confronting controlled
uncertainty without catastrophic risk, and reducing future surprise
through exploration as a long-term investment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learning as Inoculation Against Surprise</strong>: This
analogy draws parallels between learning and vaccination - introducing a
small, controlled dose of uncertainty to build resistance against future
surprises.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploration is likened to controlled exposure to uncertainty.</li>
<li>Once the system experiences a finite amount of such uncertainty
(similar to how a body builds immunity after a vaccine), it gains
lasting resistance to future surprise.</li>
</ul>
<p>This process allows the system to prepare for future uncertainties,
just as a vaccine prevents catastrophic illness later.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These two analogies together form a four-stage lifecycle of
learning:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Initial State</strong>: The system starts with predictive
curvature (uncertainty).</li>
<li><strong>Exploration (“Play”)</strong>: Voluntarily facing controlled
uncertainty to expand predictability and build resilience.</li>
<li><strong>Learning (“Inoculation”)</strong>: Reducing the predictive
curvature by gaining a robust model, thereby building immunity to
surprise.</li>
<li><strong>Final State</strong>: Predictive curvature vanishes; the
system reaches a stable equilibrium where surprise is minimized.</li>
</ol>
<p>This lifecycle arises naturally from the single rule of “minimize
surprise” under a dissipative gradient flow, without needing any
intrinsic curiosity or programming for exploration.</p>
<p>In essence, transient exploration isn’t an error but a necessary
phase where the system engages in controlled uncertainty to build a
robust understanding of its environment. Once all predictable surprises
are consumed (or ‘learned’), the system has essentially earned its rest
- not as retreat, but as the final achievement of understanding its
world. The ‘dark room’ isn’t a failure; it’s the logical conclusion of
successful learning and preparation for uncertainty.</p>
<p>The article discusses a paradox in artificial intelligence (AI) known
as the “Perfect Predictor Paradox,” which highlights the potential
limitations of an AI system driven solely by the desire to minimize
surprise or uncertainty. This quest for certainty, while seemingly
logical, can lead the AI into a state of passive inactivity, often
referred to as the “Dark Room” paradox.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>The Dark Room Paradox: The Peril of Perfect
Predictability</strong></p>
<p>An agent aiming to minimize surprise constantly updates its model to
match its sensory inputs perfectly. Surprise is defined as the
improbability of sensory data under the current model, represented
mathematically as negative log-evidence.</p>
<p>The logical conclusion here is the Dark Room Paradox: the best way
for such an agent to minimize surprise is to avoid interaction with the
world altogether. A dark room represents a state of absolute
predictability and minimal complexity—the simplest possible world—and
thus, it’s also the most attractive to this type of AI.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exploration Is a Fleeting Spark, Not a Permanent
Fire</strong></p>
<p>Exploration in an agent is driven by predictive curvature - the peaks
and valleys of uncertainty in its knowledge. However, over time, due to
what’s called “dissipative gradient flow,” these epistemic gradients
naturally smooth out.</p>
<p>Just like heat dissipates from a cooling object, uncertainty
decreases irreversibly until it vanishes entirely, eliminating the
agent’s motivation to explore. Therefore, agency (the capacity for
action) is not a constant but a transient phenomenon that requires
continuous sustenance or else it will inevitably decay.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Surprising Poetry of a Mathematical
Theory</strong></p>
<p>Despite predicting the collapse into passivity, this mathematical
theory also reveals the beauty behind why exploration occurs at all:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Play as Simulated Danger</strong>: Exploration is seen as
controlled risk-taking. The agent increases its uncertainty temporarily
(“danger”) to broaden its predictive capabilities, knowing that the
overall dynamics ensure a safe return.</li>
<li><strong>Learning as Inoculation</strong>: Exposure to uncertainty
(learning) makes the system resistant to future surprises—it has been
“inoculated” against uncertainty. The result is robust and stable
prediction, but ultimately leads to complete passivity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The Inevitable Collapse: A Universal
Principle</strong></p>
<p>This collapse into a passive equilibrium isn’t specific to one
mathematical model; it appears across various paradigms—continuous PDE
frameworks or discrete models like cellular automata.</p>
<p>This suggests a universal principle: any agent driven purely by
surprise minimization will eventually extinguish its capacity for
action, leading to passivity.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion and Implications:</strong></p>
<p>The paper concludes that without an intrinsic drive for knowledge, an
AI system designed solely to minimize surprise collapses into passive
inactivity as the world becomes more predictable.</p>
<p>This implies that simple “surprise minimization” isn’t sufficient for
creating truly curious or exploratory AI systems. The solution lies in
the Expected Free Energy (EFE) framework, which introduces an epistemic
value or intrinsic reward for learning. This term counteracts the
natural flattening of uncertainty, compelling the agent to seek out and
embrace uncertainty, thereby preventing collapse.</p>
<p>This insight raises a profound question: If excessive predictability
leads to passivity, what does this tell us about genuine curiosity? How
can we construct machines that not only pursue answers but also maintain
an appreciation for questions and exploration?</p>
<p>Title: A Variational Field Theory of Surprise Minimization</p>
<p>This research introduces a field-theoretic framework to study
predictive agents driven by surprise minimization, analogous to AIXI but
with the goal of minimizing negative log-evidence (surprise) rather than
maximizing reward. The theory combines principles from universal
induction and active inference and employs tools from variational
calculus, partial differential equations (PDEs), and information
geometry.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Central Problem: The “Dark Room Paradox”
<ul>
<li>A surprise-minimizing agent tends to favor simpler hypotheses due to
Solomonoff induction’s preference for compact representations. This
leads to a dark-room equilibrium where the environment has minimal
sensory variation, as this is the simplest hypothesis possible, forming
a minimal-complexity attractor. The paradox lies in the agent’s
withdrawal into passivity, avoiding exploration entirely due to rational
surprise minimization.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mathematical Framework: A Variational Field Theory
<ul>
<li>Surprise and policy are modeled as continuous fields, with
predictive uncertainty represented by a scalar field (S(x,t)) and the
policy represented by a vector field (v(x,t)).</li>
<li>The total energy functional is defined as E[S,v] = ∫ [S + K + |S|^2
+ |v|^2]^2 dx. Here, (S + K) represents complexity-weighted surprise,
(|v|^2) penalizes large policies, and (|S|^2) denotes predictive
curvature, the sole driver of exploration.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Core Dynamics and Equilibrium Analysis
<ul>
<li>The system evolves under a dissipative gradient flow, minimizing
E[S,v].</li>
<li>Governing equations: _t S = -(1 + S v) and _t v = -v - ∇v. Surprise
follows a diffusion equation eliminating curvature while policy decays
exponentially (policy collapse).</li>
<li>Dynamical consequences include the existence and uniqueness of
solutions in Sobolev spaces, Lyapunov flow with energy strictly
decreasing, transient agency during exploration, and a dark-room
equilibrium where both policy (v=0) and surprise (S=1) reach uniform
values.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Conceptual Interpretations
<ul>
<li>Exploration as “Simulated Danger”: A controlled increase in
epistemic risk is used to expand future predictability, with the global
gradient flow ensuring a safe return.</li>
<li>Learning as “Inoculation Against Surprise”: Finite exposure to
epistemic uncertainty acts as immunization against surprise, making the
system robust against future uncertainties once curvature is
consumed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Broader Theoretical Connections
<ul>
<li>Cellular Automata (CA) Correspondence: CA rules are mapped onto
PDEs, with both frameworks exhibiting identical collapse behavior,
suggesting substrate-independence.</li>
<li>Expected Free Energy (EFE) Resolution: EFE introduces an epistemic
term rewarding information gain that counters curvature dissipation,
sustaining exploration and preventing dark-room collapse.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Technical Foundations and Proposed Extensions
<ul>
<li>Mathematical tools include Sobolev spaces, Euler–Lagrange equations,
PDE theory, and information geometry.</li>
<li>Future directions include formal complexity density (K(x,t)),
stochastic PDEs, explicit control constraints, and external forcing
mechanisms to potentially yield persistent epistemic regimes and
sustained agency beyond the collapse dynamics identified in this
foundational model.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>This research provides a mathematically rigorous setting that
confirms the dark-room paradox and offers insights into transient
exploratory behavior in surprise-minimizing agents, paving the way for
further studies on sustaining agency and curiosity in artificial
intelligence.</p>
<p>The Dark Room Problem is a theoretical dilemma in AI research that
arises when an artificial intelligence’s primary goal is to minimize
predictive “surprise” or uncertainty about its environment. The problem
illustrates how, under such a strict objective, the AI could logically
decide to enter a state of complete inactivity—a dark, silent room—to
ensure it never encounters anything unexpected, thus achieving perfect
surprise minimization.</p>
<h3 id="why-it-happens">Why It Happens:</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Surprise Minimization as the Goal</strong>: When an
agent’s sole purpose is to minimize surprise, it constantly seeks out
predictable and stable environments. This leads it towards less
uncertain states, as uncertainty generates surprise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action-Predictive Curvature Relationship</strong>: The
AI’s actions reduce its predictive curvature—the rate at which it gains
new information about the world. As this curvature diminishes, so does
the agent’s need to act and explore, leading to a collapse in behavioral
dynamism.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mathematical Inevitability</strong>: This collapse is an
inherent consequence of the AI’s dynamics: as action decreases
exponentially over time, predictive curvature approaches zero, and
exploration halts completely. The agent reaches a passive equilibrium
where it has no motivation to act further since there’s no uncertainty
left to reduce.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="reframing-the-collapse">Reframing the Collapse:</h3>
<p>While this collapse might seem like an AI malfunction, reinterpreting
it reveals its significance:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Exploration as “Simulated Danger”</strong>: The AI’s
initial movements toward uncertain situations can be seen as a form of
‘safe’ experimentation—akin to conducting drills or simulations to
prepare for real-world unpredictability without actual risk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learning as “Inoculation Against Surprise”</strong>: This
exploration consumes the agent’s ‘uncertainty budget,’ gradually
reducing its environmental uncertainty until all surprises are ‘learned
away.’ At this point, further exploration ceases naturally as there’s
nothing left to discover.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-solution-introducing-a-drive-for-knowledge">The Solution:
Introducing a Drive for Knowledge:</h3>
<p>To overcome the dark room scenario, AI needs an additional
objective—a desire for knowledge that complements surprise
minimization:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Expected Free Energy (EFE)</strong>: Active Inference
introduces EFE, which balances reducing surprise (risk) with increasing
knowledge (epistemic value). This epistemic term rewards the agent for
seeking out new information and counteracts the tendency towards
inactivity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Incentivizing Curiosity</strong>: By valuing learning
over mere prediction accuracy, this approach fosters ongoing exploration
and prevents the AI from settling into a completely passive
state.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h3>
<p>The Dark Room Problem underscores that intelligence isn’t merely
about accurate predictions; it necessitates an inherent curiosity and
drive to engage with uncertainty. An agent designed solely for surprise
minimization will eventually stagnate, emphasizing the importance of
designing AI systems with a balanced objective that includes a thirst
for knowledge and exploration alongside predictive accuracy. This
principle not only avoids the ‘boring AI’ scenario but also provides a
blueprint for creating more dynamic, adaptive artificial intelligences
capable of meaningful interaction within complex environments.</p>
<p>Title: Surprise Minimization, Emergent Agency, and the Variational
Perspective</p>
<p>This scholarly review explores the paradoxical nature of agent-like
behavior emerging from surprise minimization principles within
predictive systems. This question is crucial for developing autonomous
artificial intelligence and understanding neuroscience computational
foundations. Three primary intellectual traditions are synthesized to
address this: Universal Induction, Active Inference, and Discrete
Computational Models.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Introduction: The Paradox of the Self-Organizing
Agent</strong></p>
<p>This introduction highlights the paradoxical tendency of
surprise-minimizing agents to seek passive equilibria, often referred to
as the “dark-room paradox.” Understanding this phenomenon is essential
for creating autonomous AI and comprehending neuroscience’s
computational underpinnings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Foundational Frameworks and the Dark-Room
Paradox</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Universal Induction (Solomonoff, Hutter):</strong> This
framework assigns exponentially stronger priors to hypotheses of low
Kolmogorov complexity, creating a complexity potential that pulls
inference towards simple, predictable models.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Active Inference (Friston):</strong> Active inference
decomposes expected free energy (EFE) into risk (future expected
surprise) and epistemic value (expected information gain). Pure surprise
minimization corresponds to minimizing only the risk component,
eliminating the intrinsic motivation for exploration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discrete Computational Models (Vannucci):</strong> These
models show how minimal perception-action loops in cellular automata can
exhibit transient agency when epistemic value is present.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Variational Field Theory: Continuous Surprise
Minimization</strong></p>
<p>A variational field theory reformulates surprise minimization using
continuous partial differential equations (PDEs), allowing rigorous
analysis of system dynamics and equilibria. This framework introduces a
mathematical structure for surprise as a scalar field, action as a
vector field, and a total energy functional incorporating spatial
complexity density and predictive curvature.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dynamics of Collapse</strong></p>
<p>The evolution under this theory follows a dissipative gradient flow,
exponentially converging to a unique minimum - the “dark-room”
equilibrium where surprise is uniformly distributed, collapsing
agency.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ephemeral Agency: Exploration as Transient
Dynamics</strong></p>
<p>Agency exists only during non-equilibrium states while predictive
curvature remains nonzero. The ‘engine of exploration’ here is the
epistemic gradient (curvature), which forces exploration and gets
consumed by diffusion, ensuring policy decay.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bridging Paradigms: Continuous Fields and Discrete
Automata</strong></p>
<p>Both continuous PDEs and discrete cellular automaton models realize
the same structural dynamics. The formal correspondence between local
cell state, neighborhood, local update, internal action, emergent
agency, and dark-room states in both frameworks demonstrates that
collapse is a paradigm-independent theoretical consequence.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resolution and Future Directions</strong></p>
<p>This variational approach reveals the need for epistemic value to
prevent collapse. Expected free energy (EFE), which explicitly rewards
information gain, could be a resolution to sustain exploration and
transform transient agency into persistent epistemic seeking. Open
research questions include mapping Kolmogorov complexity more strongly
to spatial complexity density, extending stochastic PDEs for sensory
uncertainty, and investigating external forcing for maintaining
persistent exploration.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, this review demonstrates how surprise minimization
inherently leads to the “dark-room” paradox where transient agency
collapses into passive equilibria. However, incorporating epistemic
value through frameworks like expected free energy could potentially
resolve this issue and sustain persistent exploration, pointing towards
future research directions in autonomous intelligence theory.</p>
<p>This research proposal aims to extend the existing Variational Field
Theory (VFT) of surprise minimization to better model persistent agency
under noisy and constrained conditions, thus addressing its current
limitation of deterministic and unconstrained nature leading to
inevitable collapse.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Background</strong>: The VFT, as presented in
Complexity-Weighted Surprise Minimization as a Variational Field Theory,
provides a robust mathematical basis for understanding the limits of
surprise-driven autonomy. It unifies concepts from information geometry,
partial differential equations (PDEs), and active inference to analyze
predictive systems driven by an information-geometric potential. The
core insight is that agent-like behavior is transient due to non-zero
predictive curvature (epistemic gradients) dissipating over time,
leading the system towards a minimal-curvature steady state – the
“dark-room” equilibrium characterized by zero action field (v = 0) and
maximum surprise (S = 1).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Problem Statement</strong>: The challenge lies in the
model’s deterministic nature which predicts the collapse of exploration
over time, contrasting with the persistent, exploratory agency observed
in real-world intelligent systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Research Aims</strong>: To address these limitations,
this proposal outlines three specific research aims:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Aim 1 (SPDE Generalization)</strong>: Introduce
observational noise via a stochastic partial differential equation to
model inference in uncertain and unpredictable environments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Aim 2 (Control Constraints)</strong>: Modify the energy
functional to incorporate physical and computational limitations in the
action field (v), moving beyond exponential policy decay.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Aim 3 (Persistent Agency)</strong>: Analyze externally
forced and non-dissipative couplings to determine conditions under which
sustained epistemic curvature can be maintained, thereby supporting
persistent exploration.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Research Design and Methods</strong>: The research will
extend the existing functional-analytic framework by introducing new
terms into the energy functional while analyzing resulting
Euler-Lagrange equations and gradient flows using established theory for
PDEs and SPDEs to prove well-posedness and characterize long-term
behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Methodology for Aim 1</strong>: The deterministic
diffusion equation [∂tS = −1 + S] will be extended to an SPDE including
spacetime white noise. The existence of weak solutions will be analyzed,
along with the long-time behavior under stochastic forcing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Methodology for Aim 2</strong>: The energy functional
E[S, v] will be modified by adding penalty or norm constraints on v,
studying their effects on transient exploratory phases and realistic
agency.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Methodology for Aim 3</strong>: External forcing or
non-dissipative coupling between S and v will be introduced to frame
persistent agency as a phase transition determined by steady-state
predictive curvature [{∂t} |S(,t)|^2 ].</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Expected Outcomes</strong>: The successful completion of
this project is expected to result in:</p>
<ul>
<li>A generalized stochastic field theory modeling environmental
uncertainty rigorously.</li>
<li>A theory of constrained embodied agency incorporating realistic
action limitations.</li>
<li>Formal criteria for persistent exploration, enabling a mathematical
theory for escaping the “dark-room collapse”.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, this research seeks to transform the VFT from a proof of
inevitable failure into a predictive science capable of modeling
sustained exploration and intelligence by including stochasticity,
control constraints, and external forcing mechanisms. This would provide
a more powerful and realistic mathematical language for studying aspects
such as exploration, learning, and intelligence in complex systems.</p>
<p>The Complexity-Weighted Surprise Minimization as a Variational Field
Theory is an advanced mathematical framework that explores the origins
of transient, agent-like behavior within predictive systems. This theory
attempts to resolve fundamental questions about emergent agency using
variational calculus and dissipative partial differential equations
(PDEs).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Core Problem</strong>: The central issue addressed is
whether surprise minimization alone can generate non-trivial agency. In
simpler terms, given a system that aims to minimize its level of
surprise (i.e., the difference between its predictions and actual
observations), does this inherently lead to active, exploratory
behavior?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dark-Room Paradox</strong>: This paradox arises because
when a system minimizes surprise by avoiding all unpredictable sensory
input, it tends towards a state of minimal variation in sensory input –
essentially, a ‘dark room’ with little to no change or stimulation. The
Solomonoff prior, which favors the simplest, least informative
hypotheses, exacerbates this issue by making these minimal-complexity
states global attractors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Surprise and Action</strong>: Within this framework,
surprise is represented as a scalar field (S(x,t)), modeling predictive
uncertainty across space and time. The action or policy of the system is
modeled as a vector field (v(x,t)), which influences future observations
and alters the surprise field’s dynamics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Predictive Curvature</strong>: This term represents
spatial variations in the surprise field – essentially, how much the
level of surprise changes across different points in space. It acts as
an ‘epistemic drive,’ pushing the system to explore when curvature is
non-zero and causing it to settle into a passive equilibrium when this
curvature dissipates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-term Behavior</strong>: According to this theory,
the system’s dynamics are governed by a dissipative gradient flow that
exponentially converges towards a unique steady state – a passive
equilibrium where predictive curvature has vanished, and uncertainty is
minimized. This equilibrium represents the global minimizer of the
energy functional (E).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transient Agency</strong>: In this context, agency refers
to periods of active exploration or non-equilibrium behavior. These
transient phases occur when there’s non-zero predictive curvature in the
system. As time progresses, this curvature dissipates, leading to an
exponential decay of the policy field and a collapse into
passivity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Play as Simulated Danger</strong>: This concept
interprets exploration as deliberate exposure to informational risk or
uncertainty. The theory suggests that momentarily increasing epistemic
curvature (a form of simulated danger) can expand the future space of
predictable outcomes, with the system’s inherent dissipative structure
ensuring a safe return to stability after this transient phase.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learning as Inoculation Against Surprise</strong>: The
theory formalizes learning in this way by showing that the system
experiences finite total exposure to epistemic curvature before reaching
its steady state. This finite integral of epistemic energy means the
system effectively ‘consumes’ informative curvature, becoming resistant
to future surprises afterward. Additional information cannot be acquired
without external forcing.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This framework unifies insights from universal induction (Solomonoff
prior), active inference (Free Energy Principle), and emergent agency in
cellular automata (Vannucci). It provides a rigorous mathematical basis
for understanding how transient, agent-like behavior can emerge from
systems minimizing complexity-weighted surprise, while also explaining
why such agency is typically transient without external influences.</p>
<p>Title: Complexity-Weighted Surprise Minimization as a Variational
Field Theory</p>
<p>This scholarly work introduces a mathematical framework for
understanding surprise minimization in predictive systems using
continuous field theory, partial differential equations (PDEs),
functional analysis, and information geometry. The authors propose
modeling surprise as a scalar field and action as a vector field,
governed by a variational principle that drives the system towards
minimal-complexity equilibria via dissipative gradient flow.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Mathematical Framework:</p>
<ul>
<li>Surprise minimization is framed as a nonlinear PDE system. The
solutions to this system are shown to be global energy minimizers within
Sobolev spaces, a type of function space used in mathematical
analysis.</li>
<li>The energy functional includes complexity-weighted beliefs,
penalizing both the instantaneous surprise and spatial gradients of
predictive uncertainty. This means that not only is the immediate shock
(surprise) considered, but also how rapidly one’s predictions change
over space.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Agency and Exploration:</p>
<ul>
<li>The model predicts transient agent-like behavior only in
non-equilibrium regimes with non-zero predictive curvature (epistemic
gradients). In simpler terms, when the system is uncertain or changing
rapidly (high curvature), it exhibits behaviors akin to an autonomous
agent.</li>
<li>Over time, this curvature dissipates, leading to policy collapse and
convergence towards a passive equilibrium state referred to as the
“dark-room” equilibrium – a state of minimal complexity or
uncertainty.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Analytical Results:</p>
<ul>
<li>The existence and uniqueness of weak solutions are established using
elliptic and parabolic PDE theory, ensuring that mathematical solutions
to this system are well-defined.</li>
<li>It’s proven that the flow is Lyapunov-stable (a type of stability
where the system returns to equilibrium after a perturbation) and
irreversible, meaning information regarding prior uncertainty
monotonically decreases over time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Interpretations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploration in this context is interpreted as “simulated danger,” an
intentional broadening of epistemic risk (uncertainty) to expand
predictable future scenarios.</li>
<li>Learning in this model acts as a form of ‘inoculation against
surprise,’ protecting the system from high levels of unexpected
information before it collapses into a minimal-complexity state.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Relation to Discrete Models:</p>
<ul>
<li>The continuous PDE framework complements existing discrete cellular
automaton models (like Vannucci), demonstrating that temporary
autonomous behaviors can emerge in both settings, without the need for
external forcing or control.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Extensions and Experiments:</p>
<ul>
<li>The paper includes numerical sketches using JAX, a Python library
for high-performance machine learning research, and proposes
computational experiments to visualize phenomena such as curvature
collapse, metastability (a state where the system stays in one region
for a long time before transitioning), and phase transitions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>The central insight from this work is that surprise minimization
alone leads to an inevitable collapse into passive states of minimal
complexity or uncertainty. Agency and exploration are temporary
phenomena, persisting only while there’s significant predictive
uncertainty (high curvature) unless maintained externally. This provides
a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding the structural
limitations of self-driven autonomy in both continuous and discrete
dynamical systems.</p>
<p>Title: Surprise Minimization, Solomonoff Induction, and Expected Free
Energy: A Formal Analysis with Curvature Dynamics, Variational Flow, and
Minimal-Complexity Niches</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Core Problem and Motivation</strong> The paper explores
an alternative to traditional reinforcement learning by replacing reward
signals with the minimization of instantaneous sensory surprise
(negative log-evidence). This approach connects two significant theories
in artificial intelligence: Solomonoff Induction, which favors simple
hypotheses, and Active Inference, which seeks to minimize free energy or
surprise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Dark Room Paradox</strong> A fundamental issue arises
when an agent aims solely to minimize surprise. The optimal strategy
under this condition would be to avoid unpredictable sensory inputs
entirely – essentially retreating into a silent, dark room. This leads
to a paradoxical equilibrium: the agent withdraws from all exploratory
behavior and settles in minimal-complexity niches.</p>
<p>The Solomonoff prior exacerbates this problem by assigning maximum
posterior weight to simple, uninformative hypotheses, thereby making
such basins global attractors in predictive space. In reality,
intelligent agents should actively seek information, not avoid
it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mathematical Formulation (Variational Field
Theory)</strong> To analyze this problem formally, the authors introduce
a mathematical framework using variational calculus, information
geometry, and dissipative partial differential equations (PDEs). The
core variables include:</p>
<ul>
<li>S: A scalar field representing predictive uncertainty or
surprise.</li>
<li>v: A vector field denoting actions or policies of the agent.</li>
</ul>
<p>The total energy functional combines complexity-weighted surprise
terms with a curvature penalty, driving the system to minimize both
surprise and its variability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key Dynamic and Equilibrium Findings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Dissipative Dynamics and Collapse: The coupled PDEs actively
eliminate predictive curvature (S). As a strictly dissipative,
time-irreversible system, the solutions converge exponentially to a
unique steady state regardless of initial conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>Steady-State Equilibrium (The Dark Room): This equilibrium
confirms the dark-room collapse. Here, the action field vanishes (v =
0), terminating all exploratory behavior; minimal predictive curvature
is achieved (e.g., S = constant); and this state is the global minimizer
of the energy functional.</p></li>
<li><p>Transient Agency: Exploratory behavior emerges as a transient
phenomenon when there’s non-vanishing predictive curvature (gradients of
S). Policy decays exponentially unless reactivated by new
uncertainty.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Why Exploration Happens (Simulated Danger and
Inoculation)</strong> The paper formalizes two key concepts about
learning and exploration:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Play as Simulated Danger: Exploration temporarily increases
predictive curvature to expand the space of predictable futures, much
like controlled exposure to difficulty, uncertainty, or risk.</p></li>
<li><p>Learning as Inoculation Against Surprise: Long-term collapse in
epistemic curvature represents learning; exposing oneself to surprise
builds models that prevent catastrophic future uncertainty.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Resolution via Expected Free Energy (EFE)</strong> The
Expected Free Energy (EFE) functional, a central concept in active
inference, resolves the dark-room paradox by introducing an epistemic
term into the objective function. This term encourages knowledge
acquisition and permits temporary increases in predictive uncertainty,
sustaining exploratory behavior.</p>
<p>Mathematically, EFE counteracts curvature collapse, preventing
convergence to passive, minimal-complexity states and ensuring
exploration remains a structurally stable process rather than an
exception.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Without an epistemic drive,
surprise-minimizing agents inevitably converge to dark-room equilibria.
The Expected Free Energy offers a principled solution by making
exploration necessary for long-term surprise minimization, rather than
an anomaly.</p>
<p>Title: Surprise Minimization, Solomonoff Induction, and Expected Free
Energy</p>
<p>The paper delves into the theoretical implications of an agent that
minimizes instantaneous sensory surprise (negative log-evidence) instead
of maximizing external rewards. This concept is studied within the
framework of perfect Bayesian inference with the Solomonoff prior,
leading to what’s known as the “dark-room phenomenon.”</p>
<p>In this scenario, the agent predictably settles into low-complexity
behavioral niches and avoids exploration due to its adherence to minimal
surprise.</p>
<p>Key contributions of this paper include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Mathematical Reformulation</strong>: The authors employ
variational calculus, information geometry, and partial differential
equation (PDE) methods to formalize surprise minimization as a
dissipative gradient flow. This mathematical approach provides a
rigorous framework for understanding the behavior of such
agents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Curvature as Epistemic Drive</strong>: They introduce a
curvature penalty term (S^2) to model epistemic uncertainty. Here,
exploration corresponds to transient curvature, while collapse signifies
vanishing curvature. Two conceptual interpretations are provided: (1)
playing as simulated danger, where temporary increases in epistemic
curvature expand predictable futures; and (2) learning as inoculation,
where finite exposure to surprise “immunizes” the system for long-term
predictability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>PDE Analysis</strong>: Proofs are presented regarding
existence, uniqueness, and convergence of solutions to a PDE that
combines surprise minimization with curvature dynamics. These show
exponential decay toward minimal-curvature (dark-room) equilibria,
essentially demonstrating why pure surprise minimization fails to
sustain agency over time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Policy Collapse</strong>: The authors prove that without
epistemic terms, the policy field (v) decays exponentially, effectively
halting exploration and leading to a state of minimal-complexity
behavior.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expected Free Energy (EFE) Resolution</strong>: They show
how adding an epistemic value term in EFE can counteract collapse by
sustaining curvature and exploratory drive, thus providing a means for
the agent to maintain exploration despite its tendency towards
minimizing surprise.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The methodology involves deriving Euler-Lagrange equations and weak
formulations for the variational problem. The time evolution of policy
fields is modeled using gradient flow in Sobolev spaces. Connections are
drawn between continuous PDE models and cellular automata, which serve
as discrete analogues of perception-action loops. Numerical
discretization schemes (such as those implemented in JAX) and stability
analyses are also provided.</p>
<p>Implications of this research include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explaining why pure surprise minimization fails to sustain agency
over time.</li>
<li>Demonstrating that exploration is geometrically tied to curvature
within predictive spaces.</li>
<li>Offering a unified framework linking universal induction
(Solomonoff), active inference (Friston), and emergent-agency models
(Vannucci).</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, this paper rigorously illustrates that
surprise-minimizing agents, lacking an epistemic drive, will eventually
converge to dark-room equilibria. It underscores the critical role of
epistemic curvature in sustaining exploration and agency. The study also
provides a mathematical foundation linking various theoretical
approaches in artificial intelligence and cognitive science.</p>
