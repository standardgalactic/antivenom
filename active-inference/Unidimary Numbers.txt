Introduction
Unidimary numbers form a positional numeral system based on the noninteger base 3/2, often
called base one and a half. Although unconventional, this system exhibits deep structural properties
linking discrete combinatorics, number representation, rescaling symmetry, beta expansions, and
computational models such as the exploding dots paradigm.
In this essay I present a uniﬁed exposition combining all sketches, drafts, illustrations, examples,
and conceptual interpretations, including decimal veriﬁcation, symbolic arithmetic, lookup tables,
and a Python script for conversion. I also explore conceptual analogies with lamphrodynamic ﬂow
and ﬁeld-theoretic recursion in my larger frameworks (RSVP, TARTAN, semantic recursion, etc.).

What Are Unidimary Numbers?
In ordinary positional notation, we choose an integer base b and write every nonnegative integer N
in the form
N =
m
X
k=0
dkbk,
where the digits dk are integers in {0, 1, . . . , b −1}.
Unidimary numbers are the same idea carried over to a non-integer base. Here the base is
b = 3
2,
so we are working in "base one and a half." Remarkably, every nonnegative integer still has a ﬁnite
positional representation, but now the digits are restricted to {0, 1, 2}:
N =
m
X
k=0
dk

k
,
dk ∈{0, 1, 2}.
When we write the number in base 3/2, the leftmost digit is the coeﬃcient of the highest power of
3/2, just as in base 10 or base 2.

The 3 →2 Exploding Box Rule
The most intuitive way to generate unidimary representations is the "exploding dots" or 3 →2 box
rule.
Imagine an inﬁnite row of boxes extending to the left. We place dots in the rightmost box to
represent an integer N. The rule is:
Whenever a box contains 3 dots, we remove those 3 dots and add 2 dots to the next
box on the left.

We repeatedly apply this rule until every box contains at most 2 dots. At that point, the conﬁgu-
ration is stable.
This matches the identity

Example: Representing 10
Through explosions we obtain:
(2101)3/2
Check:
2 · 3.375 + 1 · 2.25 + 0 + 1 = 10
6
Example: Representing 14
Explode and obtain
(2122)3/2
Check:
2 · 3.375 + 1 · 2.25 + 2 · 1.5 + 2 = 14.

Decimal Interpretation and Integer Preservation
Each digit is multiplied by fractional powers of (3/2), but the total always sums to an integer
because the 3 →2 rule enforces the identity
3 · (3/2)k = 2 · (3/2)k+1.
8
Another Example: (2120)3/2 = 12
(2120)3/2 = 2 · 3.375 + 1 · 2.25 + 2 · 1.5 = 12.

Arithmetic in Unidimary Notation
Adding (2101)3/2 and (2)3/2:
(2101)3/2 + (2)3/2 = (2120)3/2.
Explosions occur whenever a digit reaches 3.

Beta Expansions and Irrational Bases
Base-3/2 belongs to the broader theory of β-expansions:
representations in non-integer bases
(Rényi, Parry). Famous examples include base φ (golden ratio). These systems bridge discrete
and continuous representations, symbolic dynamics, and number theory.

Conceptual Connections to RSVP and Field Theory
Although unidimary numbers arise from a simple combinatorial rule, they illustrate several themes
from the RSVP framework and lamphrodynamic ﬁeld theory:
1. Nonlinear ﬂow with a preserved quantity. The 3 →2 rule deﬁnes a dynamics preserving
total value. This mirrors lamphrodynamic ﬂows which preserve an information-like invariant
while redistributing structure.
2. Multiscale recursion. Moving one box left multiplies by (3/2), creating a recursive multi-
scale decomposition analogous to semantic recursion in TARTAN or lamphrodynamic scaling.
3. Complexity minimization. Explosions stabilize digits into {0, 1, 2}, compressing a large
integer into a stable symbolic form. This resembles curvature-minimizing ﬂows.
4. Discrete / Continuous Correspondence. The exploding-box picture is discrete and com-
binatorial, while the analytic expansion uses continuous fractional powers. Their equivalence
mirrors discrete PDE approximations and CA/PDE correspondences in RSVP models.
