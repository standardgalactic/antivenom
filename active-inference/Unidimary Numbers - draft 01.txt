What Are Unidimary Numbers?
In ordinary positional notation, we choose an integer base b and write every nonnegative integer N
in the form
N =
m
X
k=0
dkbk,
where the digits dk are integers in {0, 1, . . . , b −1}.
Unidimary numbers are the same idea carried over to a non-integer base. Here the base is
b = 3
2,
so we are working in "base one and a half." Remarkably, every nonnegative integer still has a ﬁnite
positional representation, but now the digits are restricted to {0, 1, 2}:
N =
m
X
k=0
dk

dk ∈{0, 1, 2}.
When we write the number in base 3/2, the leftmost digit is the coeﬃcient of the highest power of
3/2, just as in base 10 or base 2.
Throughout this note, I will call this system the unidimary system.

The 3 →2 Exploding Box Rule
The most intuitive way to generate unidimary representations is the "exploding dots" or 3 →2 box
rule.
Imagine an inﬁnite row of boxes extending to the left. We place dots in the rightmost box to
represent an integer N. The rule is:
Whenever a box contains 3 dots, we remove those 3 dots and add 2 dots to the next
box on the left.

We repeatedly apply this rule until every box contains at most 2 dots.
Why does this correspond to base 3/2?

Example 3: (2120)3/2 = 12
Another simple veriﬁcation:
(2120)3/2 = 2 · 3.375 + 1 · 2.25 + 2 · 1.5 = 12.

Decimal Interpretation and Integer Preservation
Although each position uses fractional powers of 3/2, integer values are always obtained because
the exploding-dot rule enforces

.
In other words, the dynamics preserve integer value regardless of how many intermediate explosions
occur.

Beta Expansions and Irrational Bases
Unidimary numbers are an instance of β-expansions (Rényi, Parry), where numbers are expanded
in non-integer bases β > 1.
Examples include base-φ (the golden ratio), base-e, and arbitrary β bases used in symbolic dynamics
and ergodic theory.
Base-3/2 is unusual because all integers admit a ﬁnite expansion using only digits {0, 1, 2}, which
is not generally true for arbitrary β.

Arithmetic (Very Brief)
Addition proceeds digitwise, triggering explosions whenever a digit reaches 3. For instance:
(2101)3/2 + (2)3/2 = (2120)3/2.

Conceptual Connections to RSVP and Field Theory
Although unidimary numbers arise from a simple combinatorial rule, they illustrate several themes
from the RSVP framework and lamphrodynamic ﬁeld theory:
1. Nonlinear ﬂow with a preserved quantity. The 3 →2 rule deﬁnes a dynamics preserving
total value. This mirrors lamphrodynamic ﬂows which preserve an information-like invariant
while redistributing structure.
3

2. Multiscale recursion. Moving one box left multiplies by (3/2), creating a recursive multi-
scale decomposition analogous to semantic recursion in TARTAN or lamphrodynamic scaling.
3. Complexity minimization. Explosions stabilize digits into {0, 1, 2}, compressing a large
integer into a stable symbolic form. This resembles curvature-minimizing ﬂows.
4. Discrete / Continuous Correspondence. The exploding-box picture is discrete and com-
binatorial, while the analytic expansion uses continuous fractional powers. Their equivalence
mirrors discrete PDE approximations and CA/PDE correspondences in RSVP models.

Conclusions and Further Directions
Unidimary numbers are deceptively simple: by deﬁning a local replacement rule that conserves
value, we obtain a complete positional numeration system and a beta-expansion valid for all integers.
The conceptual analogy with ﬂow, invariants, multiscale recursion, symbolic dynamics, and discrete-
to-continuous transitions resonates with many of the themes explored in RSVP theory and lam-
phrodynamics: information-preserving ﬂows, curvature minimization, and multi-resolution repre-
sentations.
Future directions include fractional unidimary expansions (analogues of decimal points), multipli-
cation and division algorithms, connections with golden-base arithmetics, and beta-shift symbolic
dynamics in ergodic theory.
