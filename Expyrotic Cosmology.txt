Over Poincaré Time

Abstract
Expyrotic Cosmology, developed within the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum
(RSVP) framework, proposes a non-inflationary, non-singular paradigm for the ori-
gin and evolution of cosmic structure. Unlike inflationary models, which rely on rapid
exponential expansion and fine-tuned initial conditions, or ekpyrotic models, which
invoke a contracting bounce, Expyrosis posits that cosmic structure emerges through
the long-timescale reintegration of decohered information encoded in the cosmic mi-
crowave background (CMB). Driven by scalar (Φ), vector (⃗v), and entropy (S) fields,
this process leverages entropic smoothing and nonlocal field coupling over Poincaré
recurrence timescales to reproduce observed homogeneity, flatness, and perturbation
spectra. This paper presents the theoretical foundations, mathematical formalism, and
observational implications of Expyrosis, positioning it as a thermodynamically consis-
tent alternative to traditional cosmologies. The accompanying Mathematical Appendix
formalizes the field dynamics, reintegration mechanisms, and computational methods,
supporting applications in cosmological simulations, cognitive science, and narrative
analysis.

Introduction
The inflationary paradigm has been a cornerstone of modern cosmology, addressing the flat-
ness, horizon, and monopole problems while generating a nearly scale-invariant spectrum of
primordial perturbations. However, its reliance on finely tuned initial conditions, specula-
tive high-energy physics, and a singular origin raises unresolved questions about its physical
plausibility.
Alternative models, such as the ekpyrotic and cyclic scenarios proposed by
Turok and Steinhardt, replace rapid expansion with a slow contracting phase followed by a
bounce, mitigating some issues but introducing challenges related to singularity smoothing
and entropy accumulation.
Expyrotic Cosmology, introduced within the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP)
framework, offers a novel approach that eschews both inflation and bounces. It conceptual-
izes cosmic structure as emerging from the reintegration of decohered information encoded
in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) over Poincaré recurrence timescales. Driven by

entropic vector flows and nonlocal field coupling, Expyrosis re-synchronizes early-universe
field configurations into coherent structures without requiring extreme energy scales or sin-
gular initial conditions.
By treating the CMB as a semantic horizon—an informational
boundary—Expyrosis reframes cosmology as a process of recursive field dynamics, offering
a thermodynamically consistent and philosophically compelling alternative.
This paper elucidates the theoretical foundations, mechanisms, and observational impli-
cations of Expyrotic Cosmology. The essay explores its conceptual underpinnings within
the RSVP framework, while the Mathematical Appendix provides a rigorous formalism,
including field equations, reintegration kernels, and computational methods for empirical
validation. The framework's interdisciplinary potential is highlighted, with applications in
cosmological simulations, cognitive science, and narrative analysis, demonstrating its versa-
tility in modeling complex emergent phenomena.

Expyrotic Cosmology: Reintegration of CMB Struc-
ture Over Poincaré Time
Expyrotic Cosmology reimagines the origin and evolution of cosmic structure through the lens
of the RSVP framework, which models physical and interpretive phenomena using a triplet
of interacting fields: the scalar semantic field (Φ), the vector entropy flow field (⃗v), and the
scalar entropy field (S). These fields evolve over a spacetime domain R4, governed by cou-
pled partial differential equations that generalize thermodynamic and geometric principles.
Expyrosis leverages these dynamics to propose a non-inflationary, non-singular mechanism
for structure formation, driven by the reintegration of decohered CMB information over long
timescales.
2.1
The RSVP Framework
The RSVP framework provides the mathematical and conceptual foundation for Expyrosis.
The scalar field Φ(x, t) : R4 →R encodes semantic density, representing the latent potential
for physical or interpretive significance, analogous to energy density in cosmology. The vector
field ⃗v(x, t) : R4 →R3 models entropic flow, capturing the directed motion of information
or energy through spacetime, akin to fluid velocity or attentional trajectories. The entropy
field S(x, t) : R4 →R quantifies interpretive ambiguity, measuring disorder or uncertainty in
physical or cognitive systems. These fields interact through diffusive, advective, and torsional
mechanisms, enabling the modeling of complex emergent phenomena, from galaxy formation
to narrative tension.
In Expyrosis, the RSVP fields are interpreted cosmologically: Φ represents the poten-
tial for structure formation, ⃗v governs the flow of entropic information, and S tracks the
thermodynamic and informational disorder of the early universe. This framework supports
applications in cosmological simulations, such as the RSVP Field Simulator, which visualizes
multiscale field dynamics.

2.2
The CMB as a Semantic Horizon
In standard cosmology, the CMB represents the universe at recombination, approximately
380,000 years after the Big Bang, marking the transition to a transparent universe. Ex-
pyrosis reinterprets the CMB as a semantic horizon—an informational boundary encoding
decohered patterns from the early universe. Rather than viewing decoherence as irreversible
information loss, Expyrosis posits that these patterns persist as latent field configurations,
accessible through long-range coupling over cosmological timescales. This perspective aligns
with information-theoretic views of complex systems, where dissipated information shapes
long-term evolution via boundary conditions or attractors.
The CMB's role as a semantic horizon enables Expyrosis to model structure formation as
a process of re-synchronizing early-universe information, rather than generating new pertur-
bations through quantum fluctuations or contraction. This approach supports applications
in cosmological data analysis, testing field dynamics against CMB temperature and polar-
ization maps.
2.3
Poincaré Recurrence and Informational Reintegration
Poincaré recurrence, a principle of statistical mechanics, states that a bounded system
with conserved energy will return arbitrarily close to its initial state over suﬀiciently long
timescales (TP, the Poincaré recurrence time). Expyrosis adapts this concept to a cosmo-
logical context, not as a literal repetition of states, but as a semantic reintegration of field
configurations. Over TP, the RSVP fields Φ, ⃗v, and S re-couple decohered information from
the CMB, smoothing entropy gradients and restoring structural coherence.
This process is driven by nonlocal field interactions, where distant regions of spacetime
influence local dynamics through reintegration kernels.
Unlike cyclic models, which rely
on geometric bounces, Expyrosis operates in configuration space, producing new structures
that mirror primordial patterns without physical reversal. This mechanism aligns with the
TARTAN Framework's multiscale simulations, tracking long-term field coherence.
2.4
Mechanism of Structure Formation
Expyrotic structure formation proceeds through four stages:
1. Initial Decoherence: At recombination, scalar and vector perturbations in Φ and ⃗v
decohere, encoding early-universe information in the CMB.
2. Entropic Smoothing: Over cosmological timescales, ⃗v drives entropic flows, smooth-
ing gradients in S via long-range coupling.
3. Reintegration Kernels: Nonlocal kernels in the field equations re-absorb decohered
patterns, aligning Φ with CMB imprints.
4. Field Attractors: Stable configurations in Φ and ⃗v emerge, guided by entropy de-
scent, producing a scale-invariant perturbation spectrum.

This mechanism reproduces the observed homogeneity, flatness, and perturbation spec-
trum without invoking rapid expansion or singular bounces, offering a thermodynamically
consistent alternative to inflation.
2.5
Observational Implications
Expyrosis yields distinct observational predictions:
• Low Tensor Modes: Unlike inflation, which predicts significant gravitational wave
signatures, Expyrosis produces negligible tensor modes due to its reliance on field
reintegration rather than rapid expansion.
• Residual CMB Coherence: Large-scale CMB anomalies, such as the axis of evil or
parity asymmetry, may reflect imperfectly reintegrated semantic memory, detectable
through phase correlation analysis.
• Entropy Flow Signatures: The evolution of S and ⃗v could manifest as anisotropic
dark energy or late-time structure anomalies, testable with galaxy surveys like the
Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).
• Time-Integrated Correlations: Long-time correlators between CMB and galaxy
distributions may reveal signatures of deep-time coherence, accessible through ad-
vanced statistical methods like two-point correlation functions.
These predictions can be tested using cosmological simulations and observational data,
supporting the RSVP Field Simulator's role in validating Expyrosis.
2.6
Comparison with Other Cosmologies
Expyrosis contrasts with existing models:
• Inflation: Solves flatness and horizon problems through rapid exponential expansion
but requires fine-tuned initial conditions and high-energy physics. Expyrosis achieves
similar outcomes through entropic reintegration, avoiding speculative energy scales.
• Ekpyrotic/Cyclic Models: Address flatness via a contracting phase and bounce
but face challenges with singularity smoothing and entropy accumulation. Expyrosis
avoids bounces, using field coupling to re-synchronize structure.
• Expyrosis: Generates structure through recursive field dynamics, leveraging entropy
as a vector field to drive coherence without singularities or fine-tuning.

Future Directions
To advance Expyrotic Cosmology, we propose:
• Field Simulations: Implement reintegration kernels in RSVP-based simulators to
model field evolution and structure formation, testing predictions against CMB and
galaxy data. This aligns with the RSVP Field Simulator's visualization capabilities.
• CMB Phase Analysis: Search for ultra-large-scale phase correlations in CMB data,
using statistical tools like power spectrum analysis to detect residual coherence.
• Quantum Extensions: Explore connections to holographic principles and Out-of-
Time-Order Correlators (OTOCs), aligning with the Unistochastic Quantum Theory
RSVP framework.
• Dark Energy Coupling: Investigate whether ⃗v and S dynamics mimic cosmic ac-
celeration, potentially unifying dark energy with entropic flows.
• Interdisciplinary Applications: Apply Expyrosis to cognitive science (e.g., model-
ing memory reintegration) and narrative analysis (e.g., tracking thematic coherence),
leveraging RSVP's versatility.
These directions leverage computational tools and observational data to validate and
refine Expyrosis, enhancing its interdisciplinary applications.

Conclusion
Expyrotic Cosmology redefines the origin and evolution of cosmic structure as a process
of entropic reintegration within the RSVP framework. By replacing inflation and bounces
with recursive field dynamics, it offers a thermodynamically consistent, non-singular alter-
native that reproduces the successes of standard cosmology. Positioned at the intersection of
physics, information theory, and semantics, Expyrosis opens new avenues for understanding
the universe as a meaning-generating system, with applications in cosmological simulations,
cognitive science, and narrative analysis. The Mathematical Appendix provides a rigorous
formalism to support these claims, enabling empirical validation and computational imple-
mentation.
