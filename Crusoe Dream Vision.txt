Rewrite this as if you are robinson crusoe stranded on an island writing an entry in his journal to whoever might read it someday explaining that he had this as a vision in a dream while he was stranded at the bottom of a cliff after falling during a foraging expedition to find food or building materials: Rain or Shine (1930) - A Summary of the Plot

In the days of yore, a young gentlewoman, Mary Rainey, becometh heir to her late father's beleaguered circus. Though well-meaning, she is unversed in the art of managing such a tumultuous enterprise. To her aid cometh Smiley Johnson, the circus's clever and unflappable manager, a man of great wit and singular resource.

Alas, all is not well beneath the canvas of the big top. The performers, disgruntled and weary, doth plot to abandon their duties, leaving Mary's inheritance teetering upon ruin. Yet Smiley, undaunted, doth rally the disheartened troupe, improvising spectacle upon spectacle—even risking life and limb—to preserve the illusion and save the day.

There is high drama: a woman imperiled upon the trapeze, a scene most dire; a fire threatened; and a crisis of confidence in the new lady proprietor. Through cunning and valor, Smiley restoreth order, revealeth his loyalty, and ensureth that the show, by God's grace, doth indeed go on.

Fiat voluntas tua. Shouldst thou desire further illumination—be it of character, theme, or production—I shall oblige.

Journal of R. Crusoe — Year of the Lord Unknown, Upon This Desolate Isle
To whomsoever one day may discover these pages — perhaps a fellow castaway, or by some miracle, a soul come from distant shores — I must set to parchment a vision most strange that did visit me whilst I lay battered and broken at the bottom of a rocky ravine. I had fallen — fool that I was — in search of vines stout enough for binding timber, or perhaps wild yams with which to fill my belly. The sun had long set, and I, barely clinging to wakefulness, did slip into a sleep wrought of pain and hunger.
And in that sleep, a dream did seize my mind — vivid as lightning in the storm — a tale not my own, yet known to me with utmost clarity, as though it had once played out before mine eyes in some theatre now lost to time and tide.
In this vision, there was a maiden called Mary Rainey, newly come into possession of her father's circus — a grand, moving place of marvels and beasts, unlike anything I have known upon this isle. But her inheritance was no blessing. The performers, weary and ill-content, plotted desertion. The spectacle threatened to crumble, much as my own hopes oft do upon this forsaken strand.
Yet there stood one — a man named Smiley Johnson — no jester he, despite his name, but a fellow of sharp mind and steady heart. He stood fast whilst others faltered. He rallied the disheartened with cunning schemes and daring feats, striving to hold together the tattered seams of Mary's inheritance. Fires threatened, a woman near perished mid-air on a perilous swing, and Mary herself did wrestle with doubt.
But Smiley — aye, he prevailed. Through trials fit to test any man's mettle, he did not falter. The show, he said — and these words echoed in my mind —
must go on
.
What import this vision hath for me, I know not. Mayhap it is naught but the addled wanderings of a bruised mind. Or mayhap it is a sign, that even amidst ruin, with courage and cleverness, some semblance of order may yet be restored.
Should I live to see another dawn, I shall take it as counsel: falter not, though the canvas be torn and the crowd gone. Stand as Smiley stood. Do what must be done, rain or shine.
Fiat voluntas tua.
