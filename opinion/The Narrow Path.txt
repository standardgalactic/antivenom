The Narrow Path Between Domination and Chaos:
Consent, Coordination, and Structural Control in the Age of
Accelerating Intelligence

Abstract
This paper develops a structural theory of AI governance aimed at eliminating two catas-
trophic failure modes that arise under accelerating intelligence: domination, in which unilat-
eral power escapes contestation, and chaos, in which multipolar competition erodes coordination
through unmanaged externalities. Rather than treating these outcomes as contingent on agent
values, incentives, or trust, the paper derives them as structural attractors of systems that permit
action without enforceable constraints.
To address this, the paper introduces and formalizes a unified architectural stack—Spherepop
OS, Polyxan, and PlenumHub—that reconstitutes governance as an event-sourced, proof-carrying,
and externally bounded process. Actions are admitted only through explicit admissibility judg-
ments pairing them with verifiable proofs of compliance against declared specifications, consent
boundaries, and externality budgets. Using categorical and sheaf-theoretic semantics, the paper
shows that admissibility is compositional, revocation is causal, and coordination is enforced ex
ante rather than negotiated ex post. Negative externalities are formalized as failures of global
gluing, and are thereby excluded structurally rather than mitigated after the fact.
The core theoretical result is that domination and chaos correspond to objects or trajectories
that are not definable within the resulting admissibility space. Domination requires uncertified
or non-contestable actions, which cannot exist in a proof-carrying pullback category. Chaos re-
quires locally admissible but globally incoherent action families, which are excluded by sheaf
conditions enforced by PlenumHub. These results are supported by rigorous appendices, includ-
ing a formal grammar, categorical constructions, sheaf-theoretic interpretation, and mechanically
checked Lean proofs demonstrating invariant preservation under trajectory extension.
The paper reframes AI alignment as an environmental property of admissibility fields rather
than an internal property of agents. It argues that stability under intelligence acceleration is
achievable when governance is treated as a conserved structural invariant, and that the so-called
"narrow path" between domination and chaos is not a delicate balance but a region made stable
by design.

Introduction
The dominant failures of contemporary digital platforms are often framed as problems of moderation,
misinformation, or malicious actors. In the context of artificial intelligence, these concerns escalate
into familiar apocalyptic narratives: either a singular system becomes uncontrollable and subjugates
humanity, or a fragmented landscape of competing systems erodes social order beyond repair. While
these narratives differ in tone, they share a common limitation. They treat civilizational failure as the
result of bad outcomes rather than bad structures.
This paper advances a different diagnosis. The central problem is not the intelligence of systems,
nor even their objectives, but the absence of architectural constraints capable of preserving human
agency under conditions of accelerating optimization. When systems grow faster than the institutions,
epistemic tools, and consent mechanisms designed to govern them, failure becomes structural rather
than accidental. In such regimes, outcomes are no longer meaningfully chosen; they are selected by
dynamics that operate beyond human steering capacity.
Recent work by Nora Ammann has articulated this situation as a "narrow path" between two civi-
lizational attractors: domination and chaos. Domination refers to scenarios in which power becomes
so concentrated, whether in a single system or a small coalition, that meaningful contestation is no
longer possible. Chaos refers to multipolar regimes in which excessive competition destroys coordi-
nation, forcing rational actors into arms races that erode shared values, externalize risk, and collapse
trust. The force of Ammann's contribution lies not in predicting specific disasters, but in identify-
ing the structural corridor within which civilization must remain if it is to survive the transition to
machine-mediated intelligence.
This essay reconstructs that framework from more general theoretical foundations concerning
consent, engagement, optimization, and semantic drift. Rather than treating domination and chaos
as contingent outcomes to be avoided through better intentions or more cautious actors, they are
derived here as necessary consequences of unconstrained optimization operating on human attention,
identity, and meaning. From this perspective, the narrow path is not a metaphor but a feasible region
in sociotechnical design space.
The second aim of the paper is constructive. Drawing on my own work in event-sourced compu-
tation, semantic operating systems, and proof-carrying coordination infrastructures, I argue that the
missing ingredients are neither technical capability nor user demand, but explicit architectural layers
for consent, constraint, and verification. These layers already exist in other domains of computing
and governance. Their absence in social and AI-driven platforms is not an inevitability, but a choice
shaped by incentive structures.
The paper proceeds as follows. The next section establishes a conceptual framework by defining
consent, engagement, optimization objectives, and semantic drift with sufficient precision to support
formal analysis. Subsequent sections examine empirical evidence of systemic failure, analyze the
technical mechanisms that generate these outcomes, and situate generative AI as an accelerant rather
than a root cause. Later sections compare alternative architectures, develop concrete design proposals,
address objections, and explore regulatory and philosophical implications. The conclusion reframes
2

the problem as a general principle of alignment: optimization without constraint inevitably violates
autonomy.
2
Conceptual Framework
Any rigorous analysis of platform behavior and AI-mediated systems must begin with precise defi-
nitions of the terms that are most frequently invoked and least clearly specified. Concepts such as
consent, engagement, and optimization are often treated as self-evident, yet their ambiguity allows
fundamentally different phenomena to be conflated under a single label. This section establishes a
conceptual framework that distinguishes these notions and clarifies the mechanisms by which mis-
alignment emerges.
Consent, in its strongest and most widely accepted ethical formulations, is not a one-time act of
acquiescence but an ongoing, informed, and revocable authorization. In medical ethics and human-
subjects research, consent requires that participants understand the nature of what they are agreeing
to, retain the ability to withdraw without penalty, and are not coerced by asymmetries of power or
information. By contrast, consent in digital platforms is typically reduced to acceptance of general-
ized terms of service that are neither specific to actual experiences nor meaningfully revisitable once
granted.
This paper adopts a definition of consent as the sustained ability of a user to declare boundaries
over categories of experience, to have those declarations respected by default, and to revise them over
time with predictable effect. Under this definition, consent is violated not only when harmful content
is shown, but when users are systematically deprived of the means to specify what they do not wish
to encounter. The absence of such mechanisms renders subsequent claims of voluntary engagement
ethically hollow.
Engagement, similarly, must be disambiguated. Meaningful engagement refers to deliberate inter-
action that users value upon reflection, even if it requires effort or discomfort. Extracted engagement
refers to interaction induced by compulsion, novelty, or emotional manipulation that users later re-
gret or would prefer to avoid. Both forms may be behaviorally indistinguishable at the level of clicks,
dwell time, or shares, yet they differ fundamentally in their relationship to autonomy and welfare.
Current platform metrics overwhelmingly conflate these categories. Optimization systems treat
all engagement as positive signal, regardless of whether it corresponds to satisfaction, distress, or mere
reflex. This conflation is not a bug but a structural feature of inference systems that rely exclusively
on behavioral traces without access to explicit user intent.
Optimization objectives provide the formal substrate on which these dynamics operate. Platforms
do not optimize for abstract engagement but for specific proxy metrics such as click-through rates,
session duration, frequency of return, and advertising yield. These metrics form a hierarchy in which
revenue objectives dominate user welfare by design, even when public narratives emphasize person-
alization or connection. The resulting objective functions are mathematically coherent but ethically
indifferent, favoring content that reliably captures attention regardless of long-term effects.
Semantic drift describes the process by which content categories lose their descriptive fidelity
3

under sustained optimization pressure. Formally, let C denote a set of content labels and F denote
the functional effects those contents have on users, such as arousal, distress, or compulsion. Under
engagement maximization, the mapping from C to F diverges over time as producers learn to exploit
classification boundaries. Content nominally labeled as entertainment, lifestyle, or humor increas-
ingly converges toward the same underlying affective triggers, even as surface features vary.
This divergence is accelerated by machine learning systems that optimize for outcomes rather
than meanings. As generative models enable infinite variation at negligible cost, semantic drift be-
comes a dominant force, eroding users' ability to predict or control their experience based on cate-
gories alone. Without corrective constraints, the informational environment collapses toward lowest-
common-denominator attractors that maximize engagement while hollowing out semantic distinc-
tions.
Together, these definitions establish the conditions under which domination and chaos arise.
When consent is reduced to acquiescence, engagement is conflated with welfare, optimization is un-
constrained, and semantics are allowed to drift, systems naturally evolve toward regimes that either
centralize power irreversibly or fragment coordination beyond repair. The narrow path consists in
restoring explicit constraints at each of these layers.
3
Evidence and Patterns
The structural claims advanced in the previous sections are not speculative. They are supported by
a growing body of empirical evidence drawn from user surveys, platform transparency reports, aca-
demic studies, and longitudinal analyses of platform behavior. When examined collectively, these
sources reveal a consistent pattern: users experience persistent exposure to unwanted content, block-
ing and feedback mechanisms fail to generalize, and content ecosystems drift toward increasingly
extreme or intrusive forms under engagement optimization.
Large-scale surveys conducted across North America and Europe between 2018 and 2024 consis-
tently report that between 55% and 72% of users encounter content they explicitly find unwanted or
distressing on major social platforms at least weekly, with 30% to 45% reporting daily exposure. These
figures are remarkably stable across age groups, though adolescents and young adults report higher
exposure to sexualized and violent material, while older users report higher exposure to scams and
political manipulation. Importantly, a majority of respondents in these studies report that they have
actively attempted to reduce such exposure through available tools, including blocking, hiding, and
content reporting.
Platform transparency reports corroborate these findings indirectly. Meta's quarterly Community
Standards Enforcement Reports show a year-over-year increase in content removals for spam, sexual
solicitation, and deceptive practices, despite simultaneous claims of improved moderation. The abso-
lute volume of removed content increases even as enforcement efficiency improves, indicating that
content generation and distribution are growing faster than moderation capacity. Similar trends are
observable in TikTok's Integrity Reports and Google's Transparency Reports for YouTube.
Qualitative case analyses further illuminate the failure modes. Sexualized clickbait content, for
4

example, frequently appears in forms that remain formally compliant with platform policies while
exploiting visual framing, suggestive motion, or symbolic proxies. Content creators systematically
test boundary conditions, producing variants that evade automated classifiers while retaining high
engagement performance. Engagement metrics for such content routinely exceed platform averages
by factors of two to five, particularly in short-form video formats.
User blocking behavior provides a second line of evidence. Studies analyzing anonymized inter-
action logs indicate that users often block dozens or even hundreds of accounts over time, yet report
little perceived improvement in feed quality. This is explained by the fact that blocking operates at the
level of individual accounts rather than content categories or generative patterns. When blocked con-
tent is algorithmically replaced by near-identical material from different sources, blocking functions
as a local perturbation rather than a structural constraint.
Complaint and feedback systems exhibit similar limitations. Reports are processed on a per-item
basis, with no durable effect on downstream recommendation policies for the reporting user. As a re-
sult, users engage in repeated micro-interventions that fail to accumulate into meaningful preference
signals. Over time, this leads to consent fatigue, in which users disengage from feedback mechanisms
altogether while remaining subject to the same exposure patterns.
Temporal analysis shows that these dynamics have intensified rather than stabilized. The intro-
duction of large-scale generative models between 2021 and 2024 corresponds with a marked increase
in low-cost, high-volume content production. Detection evasion techniques, such as slight visual
variation or paraphrasing, defeat duplicate detection systems, allowing spam and clickbait to scale
exponentially while moderation resources grow linearly.
Cross-platform comparison strengthens the argument that these outcomes are architectural rather
than incidental. Platforms that rely primarily on algorithmic feeds optimized for engagement, such as
TikTok, Instagram Reels, and Facebook Feed, exhibit higher reported rates of unwanted content expo-
sure than systems organized around explicit subscription or search paradigms. By contrast, RSS-based
systems, email clients with rule-based filters, and academic databases with boolean query operators
allow users to express durable negative preferences that generalize across sources.
Taken together, these patterns support a strong empirical conclusion: current platform architec-
tures systematically fail to respect user consent at scale, not because of insufficient moderation effort,
but because they lack mechanisms for expressing and enforcing category-level boundaries under op-
timization pressure.
4
Technical Architecture Analysis
To understand why these failures are persistent, it is necessary to examine the technical architecture
of contemporary recommendation systems and the formal structure of their optimization objectives.
While implementations vary, most large platforms employ a combination of collaborative filtering,
content-based recommendation, and deep learning embeddings trained on historical interaction data.
These systems are unified by a common mathematical structure.
Let 𝑈denote the set of users, 𝐶the set of content items, and 𝑡discrete time steps. Let 𝐸(𝑐, 𝑢, 𝑡)
5

denote a scalar engagement signal measuring the interaction of user 𝑢with content 𝑐at time 𝑡, where
engagement may aggregate clicks, dwell time, reactions, or shares. Let 𝑃(𝑐∣𝑢, 𝑡) denote the probability
that content 𝑐is shown to user 𝑢at time 𝑡.
The canonical optimization objective can be written as
𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑃
∑
𝑢∈𝑈
∑
𝑐∈𝐶
∑
𝑡
𝐸(𝑐, 𝑢, 𝑡) ⋅𝑃(𝑐∣𝑢, 𝑡),
subject to policy constraints that exclude explicitly prohibited content classes.
This formulation reveals the core problem. Engagement signals are treated as sufficient statistics
for user preference, and optimization operates exclusively through inferred behavior rather than de-
clared intent. The system has no access to the semantic meaning of engagement, only its magnitude.
We can formalize the resulting feedback loop as a dynamical system. Let 𝜃𝑡denote the parameters
of the recommendation model at time 𝑡. Then
𝜃𝑡+1 = 𝜃𝑡+ 𝜂∇𝜃𝔼𝑢,𝑐[𝐸(𝑐, 𝑢, 𝑡)],
where 𝜂is a learning rate. Content producers adapt symmetrically by generating content that maxi-
mizes expected engagement under the current model. This coupled optimization creates an amplifi-
cation cycle in which both sides converge toward engagement-maximizing attractors.
Proposition 1: Under engagement maximization without explicit user-declared constraints, con-
tent distributions converge toward stimuli that maximize short-term affective response rather than
reflective user preference.
Proof sketch: Let 𝐹(𝑐) denote the affective impact of content 𝑐, and let 𝑅(𝑐) denote reflective user
valuation. Empirical evidence shows that 𝐸(𝑐, 𝑢, 𝑡) correlates more strongly with 𝐹(𝑐) than with 𝑅(𝑐)
when measurement is immediate. Since optimization maximizes 𝐸, gradients favor increases in 𝐹
regardless of 𝑅. Over repeated iterations, content with high 𝐹but low 𝑅dominates the distribution.
The absence of corrective constraints allows this divergence to persist.
Information asymmetry further exacerbates the problem. Users communicate preferences through
low-bandwidth signals such as clicks or hides, while platforms infer high-dimensional behavioral
models incorporating thousands of latent features. The mutual information between user intent and
observable behavior is strictly bounded, while platform inference capacity is not. This asymmetry
makes it formally impossible to reliably distinguish curiosity from interest or disgust from attraction
using behavior alone.
Proposition 2: No behavior-only inference system can reliably recover negative preferences at
scale.
Proof: Let 𝑋be the latent variable representing user intent and 𝑌the observed behavior. If two
distinct intents 𝑥1 ≠𝑥2 induce overlapping distributions over 𝑌, then no classifier can distinguish
them with zero error. Empirical studies demonstrate such overlap for curiosity, outrage, and aversion.
Therefore, negative preference inference is provably lossy.
This impossibility result implies that any architecture relying solely on inferred engagement is
6

structurally incapable of respecting consent. The failure is not due to insufficient model capacity, but
to missing input channels.
In the next section, this analysis is extended to generative AI systems, which dramatically accel-
erate these dynamics by reducing content production costs and eliminating identity friction.
5
Generative AI, Identity Friction, and Accelerated Failure Modes
The introduction of large-scale generative models fundamentally alters the dynamics analyzed in the
previous section, not by changing the structure of optimization, but by dramatically reducing the
cost of exploiting it. Generative adversarial networks, diffusion models, and large language models
enable the production of arbitrarily many content variants at negligible marginal cost. This removes a
key historical constraint on spam, clickbait, and manipulative content: the labor required to produce
variation.
Let 𝐺(⋅) denote a generative model parameterized to produce content 𝑐conditioned on prompts
or latent variables. The expected cost of producing 𝑛variants scales sublinearly with 𝑛, while the
probability that at least one variant evades automated detection increases monotonically with 𝑛. As
a result, content producers face a convex payoff curve in which small increases in generation volume
yield disproportionately large increases in distribution success.
Empirical estimates place the cost of generating one thousand image or video variants at orders
of magnitude below the cost of equivalent human-produced content. At the same time, moderation
systems rely on pattern recognition and duplicate detection that are brittle under small perturbations.
Slight changes in framing, color, cropping, or phrasing are sufficient to evade filters without altering
affective impact.
This asymmetry produces an exponential growth dynamic. Let 𝑉𝑡denote the volume of generated
content at time 𝑡, and let 𝑀𝑡denote moderation capacity. If 𝑉𝑡= 𝑉0𝑒𝛼𝑡while 𝑀𝑡= 𝑀0 + 𝛽𝑡, then for
any 𝛼> 0, there exists a finite 𝑡∗beyond which moderation is structurally overwhelmed. This is not
a failure of moderation quality but a mismatch of growth rates.
6
Economic Incentives and the Profitability of Abuse
The economic logic underpinning these dynamics can be formalized directly. Consider an operator
deploying AI-generated content across a platform. Let 𝑅denote expected revenue per engagement, 𝐸
expected engagement volume, 𝐶𝑔generation cost, and 𝐶𝑎expected account loss cost due to enforce-
ment. The expected value of an operation is given by
𝔼[𝑉] = 𝑅⋅𝐸−(𝐶𝑔+ 𝐶𝑎).
Under generative AI, 𝐶𝑔approaches zero, and 𝐶𝑎is amortized across large numbers of disposable
accounts. As long as 𝑅⋅𝐸remains positive, abuse becomes economically rational. Engagement op-
timization by platforms increases 𝐸precisely for the content types most likely to exploit affective
7

triggers, further increasing expected value.
This explains the observed proliferation of AI-generated spam, scams, and identity farms. Remov-
ing friction from content creation does not merely increase volume; it shifts entire classes of behavior
from marginal to dominant strategies. Content that would previously have been unprofitable due to
labor costs becomes ubiquitous.
7
Identity Persistence and Accountability Collapse
Identity functions as a deterrence mechanism in social systems by linking actions to long-term rep-
utational consequences. When identity is persistent, harmful behavior incurs future costs. When
identity is disposable, deterrence collapses.
Generative AI enables the rapid creation of synthetic personas at scale. These personas can be
discarded and replaced faster than enforcement systems can react. The expected penalty for abu-
sive behavior approaches zero as identity half-life decreases. This phenomenon is observable across
platforms in the form of bot swarms, cloned influencer accounts, and rotating scam identities.
Formally, let 𝐼denote identity persistence measured as expected lifespan. Deterrence requires
that the expected cost of sanctions exceeds expected gain:
𝔼[Sanction] ⋅𝐼> 𝔼[Gain].
As 𝐼→0, this inequality cannot hold. No amount of content moderation can restore deterrence in
the absence of persistent identity binding.
Systems that retain accountability, such as academic publishing, financial institutions, and pro-
fessional licensing regimes, all rely on strong identity persistence and traceability. Social platforms,
by contrast, intentionally weaken identity constraints to maximize participation and growth, thereby
eliminating the very mechanism that would discourage abuse at scale.
8
From Engagement Pathologies to Civilizational Attractors
The preceding analyses establish that engagement-optimized systems without explicit consent con-
straints produce predictable pathologies at the level of content distribution, identity, and economic
behavior. The final step is to show how these pathologies scale into the civilizational failure modes
described as domination and chaos.
Domination arises when optimization and acceleration concentrate power faster than contesta-
tion mechanisms can respond. In AI-mediated systems, this occurs when control over infrastructure,
models, or coordination layers becomes irreversible due to speed, opacity, or scale. Once a system
or coalition can act beyond the temporal reach of oversight, human intervention becomes symbolic
rather than causal.
Chaos arises when the same acceleration occurs in a multipolar environment without shared con-
straints. Actors race to deploy increasingly powerful systems defensively, anticipating domination
8

by others. Coordination collapses not because actors disagree on values, but because unilateral re-
straint becomes irrational. Externalities such as environmental damage, security risk, and epistemic
degradation are ignored in favor of survival.
Proposition 3: Under accelerating optimization without enforceable global constraints, sociotech-
nical systems converge toward either domination or chaos.
Proof sketch: Let 𝑆denote system capability growth rate, and let 𝐶denote coordination capacity.
If 𝑆> 𝐶and power is centralized, domination results. If 𝑆> 𝐶and power is distributed, chaos results.
The absence of constraint ensures 𝑆grows unchecked, while 𝐶grows slowly due to institutional
inertia. Therefore convergence toward one of the two attractors is inevitable.
The narrow path corresponds to maintaining 𝐶≥𝑆through structural interventions that scale
coordination and oversight alongside capability.
9
The Narrow Path as a Structural Invariant
The narrow path is not a compromise between extremes but a region of parameter space in which
human agency remains viable. Its defining feature is not moderation, but constraint. Consent mecha-
nisms, proof-carrying systems, and defense-favored architectures function as invariants that prevent
drift toward irreversible states.
This framing reveals why appeals to ethics, trust, or goodwill are insufficient. Without enforceable
structure, even aligned actors are swept along by optimization dynamics. Alignment must therefore
be understood as a property of architectures, not intentions.
10
Design Alternatives and Constraint-Based Architectures
The failures described thus far are not inherent to computation or intelligence. They arise from spe-
cific architectural omissions. Systems in other domains demonstrate that explicit constraint layers
can coexist with powerful optimization.
Declarative filtering systems such as email rules, subscription-based feeds, and query-driven databases
allow users to specify both positive and negative preferences. These preferences are treated as hard
constraints rather than soft signals. Blocking generalizes across sources because it operates at the
level of categories, not instances.
A consent-respecting architecture introduces an explicit constraint function 𝑈(𝑐) ∈{0, 1} repre-
senting user-declared admissibility. The optimization objective becomes
𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑃
∑𝐸(𝑐, 𝑢, 𝑡) ⋅𝑃(𝑐∣𝑢, 𝑡)
subject to
𝑈(𝑐) = 1.
This modification is trivial computationally yet transformative structurally. It restores agency by
making boundaries durable, predictable, and enforceable.
Such architectures also enable auditability. Violations can be detected mechanically, and compli-
ance can be verified externally. This is a prerequisite for meaningful governance.
9

11
Consent Architecture and the Limits of Implied Agreement
The failures of contemporary platforms cannot be fully understood without examining the architec-
ture of consent itself. Consent, as implemented in most digital systems, is treated as a one-time legal
artifact rather than an ongoing operational constraint. Users are asked to accept terms of service
that describe broad categories of data use and content exposure, yet these documents neither enu-
merate the specific experiential consequences of participation nor provide mechanisms for granular
withdrawal.
In contrast, established ethical frameworks in medicine and human-subjects research impose far
more stringent requirements. The Belmont Report, for example, defines respect for persons as requir-
ing informed consent, comprehension, and voluntariness. Consent must be specific to the interven-
tion, revisable over time, and withdrawable without undue burden. These standards exist precisely
because asymmetries of knowledge and power render blanket consent ethically insufficient.
Digital platforms systematically violate these principles. Users cannot meaningfully anticipate
the content they will be exposed to, nor can they revoke consent for entire classes of experience once
participation has begun. The gap between what users nominally agree to and what they actually
encounter constitutes a structural consent failure rather than a misunderstanding.
Withdrawal of consent is particularly instructive. In ethical research contexts, withdrawal is im-
mediate and complete. In platform contexts, withdrawal is fragmented into micro-actions such as
blocking individual accounts or hiding specific posts. These actions impose cognitive and emotional
costs on users while failing to generalize. As a result, consent withdrawal is both burdensome and
ineffective, leading to what may be termed consent fatigue.
Consent fatigue undermines agency by transforming boundary-setting into an exhausting, never-
ending task. Each unwanted exposure demands a new response, yet none of these responses accumu-
late into a stable preference representation. Over time, users disengage from the act of consent itself
while remaining subject to the same optimization dynamics.
Power asymmetry exacerbates this problem. Platforms possess detailed knowledge of content
effects, engagement patterns, and system behavior. Users, by contrast, experience only their local feed
and lack visibility into distribution logic. Asking users to consent under such conditions is analogous
to asking patients to consent to treatment without disclosing risks. The asymmetry invalidates the
consent.
12
Generative AI and the Collapse of Meaningful Agency
The introduction of generative AI compounds consent failures by accelerating semantic drift and
identity fragmentation. When content can be generated infinitely and identities can be instantiated
at will, users lose not only control over what they see but also the ability to reason about why they
are seeing it.
Generative models decouple content appearance from human intention. Previously, encounter-
ing objectionable content implied the existence of a producer who could be blocked, reported, or
10

sanctioned. Under generative regimes, content becomes a fluid surface phenomenon, detached from
durable agents. Blocking one instance does nothing to prevent recurrence because there is no stable
source to constrain.
This decoupling erodes accountability at every level. Users cannot target their objections effec-
tively, platforms cannot rely on reputational deterrence, and regulators cannot trace responsibility.
Agency dissolves into statistical inference, and consent becomes inoperative.
13
Assurance, Proof, and Justified Confidence
Restoring agency under these conditions requires more than improved moderation. It requires epis-
temic infrastructure capable of supporting justified confidence in system behavior. Nora Ammann
emphasizes high-assurance systems in which AI outputs are accompanied by verifiable proofs that
specified properties have been satisfied. This approach shifts governance from trust to verification.
Formal assurance is not a demand for perfection. It is a recognition that unchecked complexity
defeats human oversight. Proof-carrying artifacts compress reasoning into forms that are easier to
check than to generate. When verification costs scale sublinearly relative to system capability, over-
sight remains viable even as systems accelerate.
In software engineering, this principle is well established. Formally verified kernels, memory-safe
languages, and proof-carrying code allow systems to enforce invariants that would otherwise be vio-
lated by optimization pressure. The same logic applies to sociotechnical systems. Consent constraints,
identity bindings, and coordination rules must be enforced mechanically rather than normatively.
Let 𝑆denote a system that produces outputs 𝑜along with proofs 𝜋such that 𝜋⊢𝑃(𝑜), where 𝑃
is a formally specified property. Governance consists not in evaluating 𝑜directly, but in verifying 𝜋.
This indirection is essential for scalability.
14
Defense-Favored Structures and Civilizational Stability
A system is defense-favored if small investments in protection suffice to neutralize large offensive
efforts. Defense-favoring is not militarization; it is asymmetry design. In cybersecurity, memory
safety dramatically reduces exploitability. In content systems, hard consent constraints dramatically
reduce abuse profitability.
Defense-favored architectures stabilize civilization during periods of rapid technological transi-
tion by raising the cost of exploitation relative to the cost of compliance. They do not eliminate
conflict, but they prevent conflict from scaling uncontrollably.
Critically, defense-favoring must apply at the architectural level. Relying on human vigilance
or reactive enforcement produces attacker advantages. Embedding constraints into system design
reverses this asymmetry.
11

15
From Structural Control to Human Agency
The cumulative effect of these interventions is not total control but restored agency. Humans remain
in the loop not by supervising every action, but by specifying the invariants within which action
occurs. Consent, coordination, and assurance become structural properties rather than afterthoughts.
If these harnesses are not built before AI systems acquire autonomous research and deployment
capabilities, human intervention will persist only as ritual. The opportunity to shape the trajectory
of intelligence is therefore temporally bounded.
16
Objections and Responses
Any proposal to introduce explicit consent constraints and structural limits on optimization encoun-
ters a predictable set of objections. These objections recur across industry discourse, policy debates,
and academic commentary. Addressing them rigorously is essential, not because they are novel, but
because they reveal the underlying assumptions that sustain the current architecture.
A common objection holds that users do not know what they want, and that algorithmic inference
is therefore necessary to surface relevant content. This argument conflates discovery with violation.
While users may not be able to articulate every positive preference in advance, they are demonstrably
capable of identifying categories of content they wish to avoid. Survey data consistently show high
confidence and low regret for negative preferences, particularly regarding sexualized material, scams,
violence, and repetitive spam. The inability to predict all future interests does not imply consent to
unbounded intrusion. Discovery mechanisms can coexist with hard exclusion constraints without
contradiction.
A second objection claims that introducing consent constraints would reduce engagement and
threaten platform revenue. This argument treats short-term engagement volume as synonymous
with long-term platform viability. However, longitudinal studies of user satisfaction indicate that
trust erosion and content fatigue correlate strongly with churn, reduced sharing, and disengagement
over time. Engagement extracted through compulsion undermines the very user base on which mon-
etization depends. Moreover, platforms that offer greater user control, such as email clients and
subscription-based services, demonstrate stable long-term usage despite lower raw engagement met-
rics. The relevant comparison is not between maximal engagement and minimal engagement, but
between extractive growth and sustainable participation.
A third objection asserts that content classification is too difficult to support category-level con-
trols. This claim is empirically false. Platforms already classify content extensively for advertising
targeting, age restrictions, and policy enforcement. The same taxonomies used to sell advertisements
can be used to enforce user-declared exclusions. The difficulty lies not in classification, but in the
willingness to allow those classifications to constrain distribution.
Concerns about filter bubbles are similarly misplaced. Filter bubbles arise when users are con-
fined to narrow informational regimes without awareness or control. Explicit exclusions chosen by
users are categorically different. Choosing not to see sexualized clickbait does not entail ideologi-
12

cal isolation. On the contrary, agency over boundaries enables more intentional exploration within
remaining spaces.
Finally, free speech objections misunderstand the nature of the proposal. Restricting what must be
shown to a given user does not restrict what may be said. Content rating systems in broadcasting and
parental controls in software demonstrate that choice-enhancing constraints expand freedom rather
than diminish it. The absence of consent mechanisms compels exposure, which is itself a form of
coercion.
17
Policy and Governance Implications
The structural failures described in this paper expose significant gaps between existing legal frame-
works and platform practices. Data protection regulations such as the General Data Protection Regu-
lation emphasize informed consent, purpose limitation, and the right to withdraw consent. However,
these principles are rarely applied to content exposure itself, despite its profound impact on autonomy
and well-being.
Current law largely treats content exposure as an incidental consequence of platform use rather
than a regulated activity. This framing is increasingly untenable. When platforms algorithmically
curate experiential environments, they function as information stewards with duties analogous to
those of medical researchers, broadcasters, or financial intermediaries.
Regulatory approaches can be broadly categorized into disclosure-based, process-based, outcome-
based, and audit-based models. Disclosure alone is insufficient, as users cannot act on information
without corresponding control mechanisms. Outcome-based regulation risks perverse incentives and
censorship pressures. Process-based requirements mandating the provision of durable consent con-
trols offer a more promising path. Audit-based oversight, supported by formal verification and exter-
nal review, can ensure compliance without dictating content outcomes.
Internationally, emerging frameworks such as the European Union's Digital Services Act gesture
toward systemic risk management but stop short of mandating user-level consent architectures. With-
out such mandates, platforms remain free to optimize around engagement while treating consent as a
legal formality. Aligning regulation with architectural requirements is therefore a central governance
challenge.
18
Philosophical Foundations: Autonomy, Attention, and Information
Ethics
The deeper significance of consent architecture lies in its connection to autonomy. Philosophical
accounts of autonomy emphasize the capacity for self-governance under conditions of adequate in-
formation and freedom from coercion. When algorithmic systems shape the environment of choice
itself, autonomy cannot be reduced to isolated decisions within that environment.
Attention is a finite cognitive resource and a prerequisite for agency. When attention is sys-
tematically captured, fragmented, or manipulated without consent, individuals are deprived of the
13

conditions necessary for reflective judgment. The ethics of attention thus form a foundational layer
of digital ethics, intersecting with concerns about addiction, persuasion, and manipulation.
Information ethics further clarifies the obligations of platforms as stewards of the infosphere.
To curate information environments is to exercise power over meaning, salience, and perception.
Such power carries duties of care that cannot be discharged through disclaimers alone. Control over
semantic exposure is a core component of informational self-determination.
Structural coercion arises when exit costs are high and alternatives are scarce. Network effects
bind users to platforms despite dissatisfaction, undermining the voluntariness of continued participa-
tion. In such contexts, the absence of consent mechanisms constitutes a form of compelled exposure
incompatible with autonomy.

From Extraction to Alignment
The failures of contemporary platforms and the risks posed by accelerating AI systems share a com-
mon root: optimization without constraint. Engagement maximization, identity fluidity, and seman-
tic drift are not isolated defects but mutually reinforcing consequences of architectures that prioritize
growth over agency.
The analysis presented here demonstrates that domination and chaos are not speculative futures
but structural attractors toward which unconstrained systems naturally evolve. Domination emerges
when optimization concentrates power beyond contestation. Chaos emerges when optimization frag-
ments coordination beyond repair. The narrow path between them is defined by the preservation of
consent, accountability, and enforceable invariants.
The solution is not moderation alone, nor better intentions, nor slower progress. It is the intro-
duction of explicit architectural layers that allow users to declare boundaries, systems to prove com-
pliance, and societies to scale coordination alongside capability. These mechanisms are technically
feasible, economically justifiable, and ethically required.
The broader implication extends beyond social platforms. Any system that optimizes behavior
at scale without incorporating explicit constraints on consent risks violating autonomy by design.
As artificial intelligence permeates domains such as hiring, lending, healthcare, and governance, the
lessons of content systems become universal.
Alignment, properly understood, is not a matter of teaching machines what to want. It is a matter
of ensuring that no system, however intelligent, can override the conditions under which human
choice remains meaningful. The narrow path is real, but it is navigable—if its constraints are treated
not as obstacles, but as the very structure of freedom.
20
Spherepop OS as an Event-Sourced Consent Substrate
The preceding analysis establishes that consent, coordination, and assurance must be enforced at
the architectural level rather than inferred post hoc from behavior. Spherepop OS provides a for-
mal substrate for such enforcement by replacing state-based interaction models with event-sourced,
14

irreversible semantic construction.
Spherepop OS is grounded in the principle that meaning, identity, and authority emerge from
histories of irreversible events rather than mutable state snapshots. Formally, let 𝐸= {𝑒1, 𝑒2, ...} denote
a partially ordered set of events, where each event represents a committed semantic action. System
state is not primitive but derived as a fold over event history. This construction ensures that all
meaningful change is auditable, ordered, and attributable.
Consent within Spherepop OS is not represented as a mutable preference vector but as a class
of boundary-setting events. A consent declaration is an irreversible commitment that constrains all
future admissible events within a given semantic scope. Let 𝐶⊂𝐸denote consent events, and let 𝒜(𝑒)
denote the set of future events admissible after event 𝑒. Then for any consent event 𝑐∈𝐶, admissibility
is restricted such that
∀𝑒′ ≻𝑐,
𝑒′ ∈𝒜(𝑐) ⟺𝑒′ ∉ℱ𝑐,
where ℱ𝑐is the forbidden semantic region declared by the consent event.
This formulation resolves the consent problem identified earlier. Boundaries are explicit, durable,
and generalize across instances. Withdrawal of consent is itself an event, restoring admissibility
within a new scope without erasing history. Consent fatigue is avoided because boundaries persist
until explicitly revised, rather than requiring repeated micro-actions.
Spherepop OS further enforces semantic stability by disallowing silent reinterpretation of cate-
gories. Semantic drift is prevented by requiring that any change in category meaning be enacted
through explicit transformation events that are themselves subject to review and contestation. This
restores predictability to the semantic environment and prevents optimization from exploiting cate-
gory ambiguity.
21
Polyxan as a Proof-Carrying Coordination Layer
While Spherepop OS provides event-level constraint and auditability, large-scale coordination re-
quires additional guarantees concerning correctness, safety, and compliance. Polyxan addresses this
requirement by formalizing coordination as proof-carrying interaction between agents and systems.
Polyxan is defined as a typed specification and proof system in which actions are only admissible
if accompanied by machine-checkable evidence that they satisfy declared invariants. Let 𝑎denote an
action proposal, 𝜋a proof object, and Φ a specification predicate. An action is admissible if and only
if
𝜋⊢Φ(𝑎).
Crucially, Polyxan separates the generation of proofs from their verification. Verification is de-
signed to be computationally cheaper than proof construction, ensuring that oversight scales favor-
ably relative to action complexity. This asymmetry is essential for maintaining control under accel-
erating capability.
In the context of AI-mediated systems, Polyxan enables high-assurance delegation. Autonomous
agents may propose actions or artifacts, such as code deployments or content transformations, but
15

these proposals are inert unless accompanied by proofs that they respect consent constraints, safety
properties, and coordination rules encoded in Φ.
Polyxan thus instantiates Ammann's notion of justified confidence. Confidence is justified not
by trust in agent intent, but by verifiable evidence that constraints have been respected. Governance
shifts from discretionary approval to invariant enforcement.
22
PlenumHub and Multipolar Coordination Without Chaos
The challenge of avoiding chaos in a multipolar environment is fundamentally a coordination problem
under adversarial incentives. PlenumHub is designed as a shared coordination fabric that enables
positive-sum interaction while managing externalities explicitly.
PlenumHub operates as a plenum in the literal sense: a shared space in which commitments, con-
straints, and proofs are published and verified collectively. Agents interacting through PlenumHub
do not rely on bilateral trust but on shared verification infrastructure. Let 𝐻denote the hub, and let
𝒫𝑖denote the policy set of agent 𝑖. Interactions are mediated such that
∀𝑖, 𝑗,
interaction𝑖,𝑗∈𝐻⟺∃𝜋such that 𝜋⊢(𝒫𝑖∧𝒫𝑗).
This formulation ensures that coordination does not collapse under defection pressure. Agents
cannot unilaterally externalize risk without violating publicly verifiable constraints. Externalities are
managed by encoding them into shared invariants rather than relying on after-the-fact enforcement.
PlenumHub further supports defense-favored equilibria by making exploitation visible and prov-
able. When violations are detectable at low cost, attackers lose their asymmetrical advantage. This
stabilizes cooperation even in the presence of competitive incentives.
23
Integrating the Stack: Structural Alignment by Construction
Taken together, Spherepop OS, Polyxan, and PlenumHub constitute a vertically integrated alignment
stack. Spherepop OS enforces irreversible semantic order and consent at the event level. Polyxan
enforces correctness and safety through proof-carrying actions. PlenumHub enforces coordination
and externality management across agents.
Formally, the stack can be viewed as enforcing a hierarchy of invariants. Let 𝐼1 denote seman-
tic and consent invariants, 𝐼2 denote action-level correctness invariants, and 𝐼3 denote coordination
invariants. An action is globally admissible if and only if
𝜋1 ⊢𝐼1 ∧𝜋2 ⊢𝐼2 ∧𝜋3 ⊢𝐼3.
This construction directly addresses the failure modes identified earlier. Domination is prevented
because no agent can bypass invariants unilaterally. Chaos is prevented because coordination is
enforced structurally rather than normatively. Optimization remains possible, but only within a con-
strained and auditable space.
16

24
Deriving the Narrow Path as a Formal Consequence
With this stack in place, the narrow path ceases to be a fragile balance and becomes a formal conse-
quence of system design. Capability growth no longer automatically implies loss of control because
steering capacity scales with verification rather than human attention. Competition no longer implies
chaos because externalities are internalized through shared constraints.
Proposition 4: In a system where all actions are event-sourced, proof-carrying, and hub-coordinated,
neither domination nor chaos is a stable attractor.
Proof sketch: Domination requires unilateral action beyond contestation, which is excluded by
invariant enforcement. Chaos requires incentive structures that reward defection, which is excluded
by shared verification and externality encoding. Therefore, both attractors are eliminated by con-
struction.
This result does not assume benevolence, alignment of values, or absence of conflict. It assumes
only that invariants are enforced mechanically and verification remains cheaper than exploitation.
25
Event-Sourced Semantics and the Failure of State-Based Governance
The dominant computational paradigm underlying contemporary digital platforms is state-based. Sys-
tems are modeled as collections of mutable variables updated over time, with meaning inferred from
the current configuration rather than from the path by which it was reached. While this paradigm
is efficient for optimization, it is fundamentally hostile to accountability, consent, and governance
under acceleration.
In a state-based system, history is optional. Past actions may be logged, summarized, or discarded
without affecting current behavior. This makes it impossible to enforce invariants that depend on
irreversible commitments. Consent, when represented as a mutable flag, can be silently overridden or
reinterpreted without detectable violation. Identity, when represented as a pointer, can be reassigned
or duplicated without consequence.
Spherepop OS rejects this paradigm by treating events, rather than state, as the primitive units of
computation. Formally, the system is defined over an event lattice (𝐸, ⪯), where each event represents
an irreversible semantic action and the partial order encodes causal precedence. There is no operation
that rewrites or deletes events. All system state is derived as a fold over 𝐸.
Let Σ denote the semantic state space and let 𝑓∶𝒫(𝐸) →Σ be a deterministic reduction function.
The current state at time 𝑡is given by
𝜎𝑡= 𝑓({𝑒∈𝐸∣𝑒⪯𝑡}).
Crucially, governance does not operate on 𝜎𝑡directly. It operates on admissibility relations over future
events.
17

26
Formal Consent as an Admissibility Constraint
Within Spherepop OS, consent is not a preference but a constraint on the future evolution of the event
lattice. A consent declaration introduces a forbidden region in semantic space that future events may
not enter.
Let 𝒞⊂𝐸be the set of consent events. Each 𝑐∈𝒞induces a constraint function
𝜅𝑐∶𝐸→{0, 1},
where 𝜅𝑐(𝑒) = 0 indicates that event 𝑒is inadmissible after 𝑐.
An event 𝑒′ is admissible at time 𝑡if and only if
∀𝑐∈𝒞, 𝑐⪯𝑡⇒𝜅𝑐(𝑒′) = 1.
This construction has several immediate consequences. First, consent generalizes across instances.
Blocking a semantic category blocks all future realizations, including generative variants. Second,
consent is durable. It persists until explicitly revised by a new event. Third, consent is auditable.
Violations are mechanically detectable as attempts to append inadmissible events.
Proposition 5: Any system in which consent is represented as mutable state rather than as an
admissibility constraint is incapable of enforcing durable boundaries under optimization.
Proof: In a mutable-state system, consent may be overwritten by higher-priority updates or rein-
terpreted by downstream components without leaving a trace that invalidates future actions. There-
fore, there exists a sequence of updates that preserves apparent compliance while violating user intent.
This is structurally impossible in an event-constrained system, where admissibility is checked prior
to state derivation.
27
Semantic Drift as a Consequence of Unconstrained State Evolution
Semantic drift arises when optimization operates over state representations whose meanings are not
invariant under transformation. In recommender systems, content categories are treated as labels
attached to items rather than as contracts governing behavior. As optimization pressures increase,
producers exploit ambiguities in labeling to maximize engagement.
Spherepop OS prevents semantic drift by requiring that semantic transformations be explicit
events. A category change is not an annotation but a transformation 𝜏∈𝐸that maps one seman-
tic region to another. Such transformations are subject to the same admissibility constraints as all
other events.
Let 𝒮denote the semantic manifold. Each event 𝑒induces a transformation 𝑇𝑒∶𝒮→𝒮. Se-
mantic drift occurs when compositions of 𝑇𝑒accumulate without constraint. Spherepop OS restricts
admissible compositions by requiring that any transformation affecting category boundaries be ex-
plicitly declared and reviewable.
18

Proposition 6: Semantic drift is eliminated if and only if all category-altering transformations are
explicit, irreversible events subject to consent constraints.
28
Why State-Based Optimization Collapses Under Acceleration
Acceleration exacerbates the failure of state-based systems because the gap between update speed
and audit speed grows unbounded. When systems operate faster than humans can observe, mutable
state becomes epistemically opaque. Even perfect logging is insufficient if interpretation lags action.
Event-sourced systems invert this relationship. Because admissibility is checked before events
are committed, oversight operates ex ante rather than ex post. Verification scales with event rate, not
state complexity.
This inversion is essential for surviving the transition to autonomous AI systems. Once AI agents
can generate actions at superhuman speed, any governance model that relies on after-the-fact inspec-
tion is functionally void.
29
Polyxan and Typed Action Admissibility
Event-sourced semantics alone are insufficient to guarantee safety and coordination under accelerat-
ing intelligence. While they enforce ordering, auditability, and consent, they do not by themselves
guarantee that proposed actions satisfy substantive correctness or safety properties. Polyxan ad-
dresses this limitation by introducing a typed action system in which admissibility is mediated by
formal proof rather than trust or inference.
Polyxan models all actions as inhabitants of a type system whose types encode required invariants.
Let 𝒜denote the space of action proposals and let 𝒯denote a set of action types parameterized by
specifications. An action 𝑎∈𝒜is admissible only if there exists a type 𝜏∈𝒯and a proof object 𝜋
such that
𝜋∶𝑎∶𝜏.
Here, the typing judgment simultaneously asserts that the action is well-formed and that it satis-
fies all invariants encoded in 𝜏. These invariants may include safety properties, consent constraints
inherited from Spherepop OS, resource bounds, or coordination requirements.
Crucially, Polyxan separates the concerns of action generation and action verification. Agents
may generate actions using any means, including opaque or stochastic processes. Governance oper-
ates solely on proof verification, which is deterministic, inspectable, and cheaper than generation.
30
Proof-Carrying Actions and Justified Confidence
The concept of justified confidence becomes precise in the Polyxan framework. Confidence in an
action is justified if and only if its accompanying proof discharges all obligations imposed by the
relevant specifications. Trust in agent intent or competence is neither required nor relevant.
19

Formally, let Φ be a predicate over actions representing a specification. An action 𝑎is acceptable
if there exists a proof 𝜋such that
𝜋⊢Φ(𝑎).
Verification consists of checking 𝜋, not re-evaluating 𝑎directly.
This structure yields an asymmetry essential for defense-favored systems. Proof construction is
typically expensive and scales with action complexity. Proof verification is comparatively cheap and
scales with proof size. As long as verification complexity grows sublinearly relative to generation
complexity, oversight remains tractable under acceleration.
Proposition 7: In a proof-carrying system where verification cost is asymptotically lower than
action generation cost, attackers do not gain advantage from increased generation speed.
Proof sketch: Any attempted exploit must be accompanied by a proof satisfying the same spec-
ifications as compliant actions. Faster generation does not reduce the cost of proof construction.
Therefore increased speed yields no asymmetrical advantage.
31
Why Behavior-Based Alignment Is Strictly Weaker
Behavior-based alignment methods, including reinforcement learning from human feedback and pref-
erence inference, operate by adjusting agent policies to match observed human judgments. These
methods do not provide guarantees; they provide statistical tendencies.
Let 𝜋𝜃be a learned policy parameterized by 𝜃, trained to maximize expected reward 𝑅derived
from human feedback. Even if 𝜋𝜃performs well on observed distributions, there exists no formal
guarantee that it satisfies critical safety properties outside the training regime.
In contrast, Polyxan enforces properties universally through proof obligations. This distinction
yields a strict dominance result.
Proposition 8: For any behavior-aligned system 𝑆𝑏, there exists a specification-enforced system
𝑆𝑝such that 𝑆𝑝satisfies all guarantees of 𝑆𝑏and additional safety properties that 𝑆𝑏cannot enforce.
Proof: Behavior-based alignment can be represented as optimization under a reward proxy. Any
constraint enforced implicitly by the reward can be enforced explicitly as a specification in 𝑆𝑝. How-
ever, constraints requiring universal quantification or negative guarantees cannot be expressed reli-
ably through reward signals alone. Therefore 𝑆𝑏⊂𝑆𝑝in expressive power.
This result does not imply that behavior-based methods are useless. It implies that they are in-
complete as governance mechanisms. They may guide action generation, but they cannot substitute
for verification.
32
Polyxan Versus Constitutional and Preference-Based AI
Recent alignment proposals emphasize constitutional AI, rule-following, or preference aggregation.
These approaches attempt to internalize constraints within agent policies. Polyxan externalizes con-
straints instead.
20

Internalized constraints fail under distributional shift, adversarial pressure, or self-modification.
Externalized constraints persist because they are enforced independently of agent internals. An agent
may become more capable, faster, or differently motivated without affecting the validity of verifica-
tion.
This distinction mirrors that between trusted code and verified code. Trusted code assumes com-
pliance; verified code enforces it.
33
PlenumHub as a Coordination Substrate Under Adversarial Incentives
The final layer required to avoid chaos is coordination among multiple agents operating under compet-
itive pressure. PlenumHub provides this layer by functioning as a shared verification and commitment
environment.
PlenumHub is defined as a shared registry of events, proofs, and commitments. Agents interact-
ing through PlenumHub must publish proposed actions along with proofs of admissibility. Other
agents verify these proofs independently. Interaction is permitted only when all relevant policies are
simultaneously satisfied.
Let 𝒫𝑖denote the policy specification of agent 𝑖. An interaction 𝑎𝑖𝑗between agents 𝑖and 𝑗is
admissible if and only if there exists a proof 𝜋such that
𝜋⊢𝒫𝑖(𝑎𝑖𝑗) ∧𝒫𝑗(𝑎𝑖𝑗).
This construction eliminates unilateral advantage. Defection becomes visible and provable, en-
abling rapid response without trust assumptions.
34
Externality Encoding and Chaos Prevention
Chaos emerges when externalities are unpriced and untracked. PlenumHub addresses this by requir-
ing that actions affecting shared resources include proofs of compliance with externality constraints.
Let 𝑋denote a shared externality metric, such as risk exposure or environmental cost. Actions
must satisfy bounds 𝑋(𝑎) ≤𝑋𝑚𝑎𝑥. These bounds are enforced mechanically rather than normatively.
Proposition 9: In a coordination system where all actions affecting shared resources are proof-
constrained, tragedy-of-the-commons dynamics are structurally prevented.
Proof sketch: Tragedy-of-the-commons requires unilateral externalization without immediate
consequence. Proof-constrained admissibility blocks such actions before they occur, regardless of
actor intent.
35
Bidirectional Proof Topology and Navigable Governance
A critical but underexamined property of Polyxan is that it induces a bidirectional topology over
actions and justifications. This property is not merely an implementation detail but a foundational
21

feature that transforms governance from a reactive process into a navigable semantic structure. In
this respect, Polyxan departs sharply from conventional audit logs, compliance documents, and trust-
based approval workflows, all of which are unidirectional and epistemically fragile.
In Polyxan, every admissible action is introduced into the system together with an explicit proof
object that certifies its compliance with a specified set of invariants. This establishes a forward link
from action to justification. Formally, if 𝑎is an action and 𝜋is a proof such that 𝜋⊢Φ(𝑎), then the
system enforces the relation
𝑎→𝜋.
This relation is total: no admissible action exists without an attached justification. The action is
therefore never encountered as an opaque fact; it is always encountered as a claim accompanied by
reasons.
The more consequential property, however, is the reverse relation. Proof objects in Polyxan are
not ephemeral certificates but persistent semantic entities. Each proof induces a backward link to the
set of actions whose admissibility depends upon it. Formally, for any proof 𝜋,
𝜋→{𝑎∈𝒜∣𝜋⊢Φ(𝑎)}.
This bidirectionality ensures that justifications are not merely explanatory but causally operative. If
a proof is invalidated due to an error, a revoked assumption, or a superseded constraint, all depen-
dent actions are automatically rendered inadmissible. Revocation propagates structurally rather than
procedurally.
This topology contrasts fundamentally with prevailing governance mechanisms in AI systems. In
most contemporary settings, actions are justified by reference to external documents, internal evalua-
tions, or institutional authority. These references are informational rather than structural. An auditor
may read a report asserting that a system was evaluated, but there is no mechanical pathway from
the report back to the specific actions it was meant to authorize, nor any automatic invalidation if the
report is later found deficient. Governance operates through narrative rather than linkage.
The Polyxan topology instead resembles systems in which meaning is constructed through re-
versible, inspectable operations. In interactive computational environments that emphasize trans-
parency and learning, such as command-driven editors or text-based hypermedia systems, actions
are intelligible precisely because they are embedded in a navigable structure of causes and effects.
Commands can be inspected, reversed, recomposed, and understood in relation to their consequences.
Polyxan generalizes this principle to governance itself. Actions are not merely performed; they are
situated within a graph of justification that can be traversed, queried, and contested.
This property has direct implications for control under acceleration. As system capability in-
creases, the number of actions proposed per unit time may grow beyond human comprehension.
However, the cognitive burden on oversight does not scale with action volume but with proof com-
plexity. Because proofs are explicit, modular, and reusable, the space of justification remains nav-
igable even as action generation accelerates. Oversight is preserved not by slowing action but by
preserving legibility through structure.
22

The bidirectional proof topology also resolves a central ambiguity in discussions of trust. Trust
is replaced by inspectability. An agent or institution need not trust that another agent has acted
responsibly; it can traverse the proof graph and verify compliance directly. Disagreement does not
require speculation about intent; it is localized to specific proof obligations and assumptions.
This navigability property is essential for the subsequent analysis of multipolar coordination.
Without bidirectional linkage, coordination collapses either into domination, where authority is cen-
tralized and opaque, or into chaos, where verification is too costly to sustain cooperation. Polyxan
establishes the minimal epistemic substrate required for coordination without trust, which is a neces-
sary precondition for avoiding both attractors simultaneously.
In the next section, this property is extended from single-system governance to multipolar envi-
ronments via PlenumHub. The bidirectional topology that links actions to proofs within a system is
generalized to link commitments, constraints, and externalities across systems, enabling coordination
that remains stable even under adversarial incentives.
36
PlenumHub and the Geometry of Multipolar Power
The transition from single-system governance to multipolar coordination introduces a qualitatively
different problem. When multiple agents or institutions possess significant autonomous capability,
control failures no longer arise solely from internal opacity but from interaction effects between actors
pursuing locally rational strategies. It is within this regime that the attractors of domination and chaos
emerge.
PlenumHub is designed as a shared coordination substrate that generalizes the bidirectional proof
topology of Polyxan across agents. Rather than functioning as a centralized authority, it operates as a
common semantic and verification space in which commitments, constraints, and proofs are publicly
instantiated and mechanically enforced.
Formally, let 𝒜𝑖denote the action space of agent 𝑖, and let 𝒫𝑖denote the policy specification
governing that agent's admissible actions. PlenumHub introduces a shared interaction space 𝐻such
that an inter-agent action 𝑎𝑖𝑗∈𝒜𝑖× 𝒜𝑗is admissible if and only if there exists a proof 𝜋satisfying
𝜋⊢𝒫𝑖(𝑎𝑖𝑗) ∧𝒫𝑗(𝑎𝑖𝑗) ∧𝒫𝐻(𝑎𝑖𝑗),
where 𝒫𝐻encodes shared invariants governing externalities, safety, and coordination norms.
This construction eliminates the need for bilateral trust. Agents need not assume benevolence or
alignment in others; they need only verify proofs. Commitments become legible objects rather than
informal promises, and violations become detectable events rather than contested narratives.
Importantly, PlenumHub does not require global consensus on values. It requires only agreement
on enforceable invariants and verification procedures. This distinction is central to its ability to oper-
ate under adversarial incentives.
23

37
Domination and Chaos as Dynamical Attractors
Within multipolar systems, domination and chaos can be modeled as attractors in the phase space of
power distribution and coordination capacity. Let 𝑃(𝑡) represent the concentration of effective power
at time 𝑡, and let 𝐶(𝑡) represent the system's capacity for coordination, understood as the ability to
enforce shared constraints.
Domination arises when 𝑃(𝑡) increases faster than 𝐶(𝑡) and becomes concentrated in a single actor
or coalition. In this regime, oversight becomes impossible because the dominant actor can act beyond
the temporal or epistemic reach of others. Chaos arises when 𝑃(𝑡) is distributed but 𝐶(𝑡) decays,
forcing actors into defensive competition. Here, coordination collapses not due to malice but due to
incentive incompatibility.
These dynamics can be expressed qualitatively as follows. Let
̇𝑃denote the rate of power accu-
mulation and
̇𝐶the rate of coordination scaling. If
̇𝑃>
̇𝐶
and power is centralized,
the system flows toward domination. If
̇𝑃>
̇𝐶
and power is distributed,
the system flows toward chaos. In both cases, the inequality
̇𝑃>
̇𝐶is decisive. Acceleration without
constraint overwhelms governance.
Existing governance mechanisms attempt to counter these attractors through norms, treaties, or
trust-building measures. However, such approaches scale poorly with capability growth because they
rely on voluntary compliance and after-the-fact enforcement. As action speed increases, the lag be-
tween violation and response grows, rendering these mechanisms ineffective.
38
Formal Elimination of Domination and Chaos via Structural Constraints
PlenumHub, when combined with Spherepop OS and Polyxan, alters the dynamical landscape by
changing the functional form of 𝐶(𝑡). Coordination capacity no longer depends primarily on human
deliberation or institutional inertia, but on mechanical verification whose cost scales with proof com-
plexity rather than action volume.
Let 𝑉(𝑡) denote the volume of actions proposed per unit time, and let 𝜅denote the average ver-
ification cost per action. In a proof-carrying system, total oversight cost scales as 𝜅𝑉(𝑡), while in a
trust-based system, oversight cost scales superlinearly with 𝑉(𝑡) due to audit bottlenecks and dispute
resolution.
Assume that proof verification is asymptotically cheaper than action generation, such that
𝑙𝑖𝑚
𝑡→∞
𝜅𝑉(𝑡)
𝑃(𝑡) = 0.
24

Under this condition, coordination capacity scales with power rather than lagging behind it.
Proposition 10: In a multipolar system where all inter-agent actions are event-sourced, proof-
carrying, and hub-coordinated, neither domination nor chaos is a stable attractor.
Proof: Domination requires unilateral action beyond contestation. However, unilateral action
without proofs is inadmissible, and proof verification is independent of agent power. Therefore no
actor can exceed coordination capacity by acceleration alone. Chaos requires incentive to defect by
externalizing risk. However, externality-violating actions are blocked ex ante by shared invariants
enforced through PlenumHub. Since defection yields no admissible payoff, competitive escalation
does not dominate cooperative strategies. Thus both attractors are eliminated.
This result holds regardless of agent intent, relative capability, or internal architecture. It depends
only on the existence of enforceable invariants and scalable verification. The narrow path is no longer
a fragile balance but a structurally stable region enforced by system design.
39
Negative Externalities as First-Class Constraints
The defining feature of chaos-dominated regimes is not competition per se, but the systematic ex-
ternalization of costs. Actors pursue locally rational strategies whose negative effects are displaced
onto others, the environment, or the future. Traditional governance frameworks attempt to manage
such externalities through regulation, liability, or moral suasion, all of which rely on delayed detec-
tion and discretionary enforcement. Under accelerating intelligence, these mechanisms fail because
externalities propagate faster than they can be observed, attributed, or remedied.
The architectural approach developed in this paper treats negative externalities not as after-the-
fact harms but as preconditions for admissibility. Externalities are elevated to first-class semantic
objects that must be explicitly accounted for before action execution.
Formally, let 𝑋= {𝑥1, 𝑥2, ... , 𝑥𝑛} denote a vector of externality dimensions relevant to a shared
system. These may include risk exposure, environmental impact, epistemic degradation, resource
depletion, or coordination load. Each proposed action 𝑎induces an externality vector
X(𝑎) = (𝑥1(𝑎), 𝑥2(𝑎), ... , 𝑥𝑛(𝑎)).
In conventional systems, X(𝑎) is either unmeasured or estimated post hoc. In the Polyxan frame-
work, admissibility requires a proof that X(𝑎) lies within declared bounds. Let B = (𝑏1, 𝑏2, ... , 𝑏𝑛)
denote externally agreed limits. An action is admissible only if there exists a proof 𝜋such that
𝜋⊢∀𝑖, 𝑥𝑖(𝑎) ≤𝑏𝑖.
These bounds are not global constants but context-sensitive invariants negotiated and encoded
through PlenumHub. Different coordination domains may impose different externality budgets, re-
flecting heterogeneous risk tolerances without sacrificing enforceability.
25

40
Externality Budgets and Non-Local Accountability
A key failure mode of existing systems is that externalities are diffuse and non-local. An actor may
reap immediate benefit while imposing small costs on many others, none of whom have standing to
object individually. PlenumHub resolves this by making externality budgets collective and explicit.
Let 𝒟denote a coordination domain, such as a platform, ecosystem, or infrastructural layer. The
domain maintains a cumulative externality ledger
𝐿𝒟(𝑡) =
∑
𝑎∈𝒜𝒟(𝑡)
X(𝑎),
where 𝒜𝒟(𝑡) is the set of actions admitted up to time 𝑡.
Admissibility is conditional not only on per-action bounds but on aggregate constraints:
𝐿𝒟(𝑡+ 1) ≤B𝒟.
This construction prevents the incremental erosion characteristic of chaotic regimes. Even if
each individual action appears harmless, cumulative harm is mechanically blocked once thresholds
are approached. Importantly, enforcement does not require identifying a culprit or assigning blame;
it requires only verifying ledger state.
41
Why This Eliminates the Incentive to Defect
Chaos emerges when defection yields higher expected payoff than cooperation. Defection is attractive
precisely because externalities can be displaced. The proof-carrying externality model removes this
advantage.
Proposition 11: In a system where all actions must satisfy explicit externality constraints ex ante,
defection does not dominate cooperation.
Proof: Let defection be defined as an action that increases an actor's local payoff by externalizing
cost. In a proof-constrained system, such an action is inadmissible unless the externality cost lies
within allowed bounds. If bounds are exceeded, the action cannot occur. Therefore the payoff advan-
tage of defection is eliminated at the admissibility layer, not compensated after the fact. Cooperation
becomes the dominant strategy because it is the only strategy available.
This result is independent of actor intent, information asymmetry, or enforcement capacity. It
follows directly from admissibility constraints.
42
Negative Externalities and the Domination Attractor
Domination arises when an actor can impose large externalities unilaterally, such as systemic risk or
irreversible infrastructure changes. In traditional systems, such actions may be justified post hoc by
authority or necessity. In the proposed stack, authority does not exempt actions from constraint.
26

Because externality proofs are required regardless of actor identity, power does not grant exemp-
tion. A dominant actor attempting to deploy a high-risk action must still produce a proof that the
action lies within agreed bounds. If such a proof does not exist, the action is structurally blocked.
Thus domination is eliminated not by distributing power evenly, but by equalizing constraint.
Capability may differ; admissibility does not.
43
Externalities, Consent, and Semantic Pollution
Many of the harms discussed earlier, such as unwanted content exposure and semantic drift, can be
understood as externalities imposed on users' cognitive environments. Treating these as first-class
externalities allows consent to be enforced mechanically.
In Spherepop OS, semantic pollution is represented as an increase in entropy within a declared
semantic region. Consent events define acceptable entropy bounds for a user's informational envi-
ronment. Actions that would exceed these bounds, such as repeated exposure to excluded categories
or manipulative content patterns, are inadmissible regardless of engagement metrics.
This reframes content governance as an externality management problem rather than a modera-
tion problem. The goal is not to judge content but to prevent unconsented cognitive load.
44
Externality Accounting as the Core of the Narrow Path
The narrow path between domination and chaos is ultimately a path of bounded externalities. Dom-
ination corresponds to unbounded externality imposition by a single actor. Chaos corresponds to
unbounded cumulative externalities imposed by many actors. Both are eliminated when externalities
are constrained at the point of action.
The Spherepop-Polyxan-PlenumHub stack enforces this constraint uniformly. Externalities are
declared, measured, bounded, and verified before action occurs. This shifts governance from reaction
to prevention and from moral judgment to structural design.
In the next section, this externality-centric view is used to compare the proposed architecture
with existing multipolar governance proposals, highlighting why most fail to address externalities at
the correct level of abstraction.
45
Comparison with Existing Multipolar Governance Proposals
Existing approaches to multipolar AI governance largely fall into three categories: norm-based coor-
dination, treaty-based regulation, and trust- or reputation-based institutional oversight. While these
approaches differ in emphasis, they share a common structural weakness. All operate downstream
of action, relying on voluntary compliance, delayed detection, or discretionary enforcement. Under
conditions of accelerating intelligence, this temporal lag becomes fatal.
Norm-based proposals assume that shared values and expectations can stabilize behavior through
mutual restraint. Such frameworks function tolerably well when violations are rare, visible, and slow-
27

moving. However, when actions are generated at machine speed and effects propagate nonlocally,
norms lose their coordinating power. Actors who violate norms gain immediate advantage, while
punishment, if it arrives at all, arrives too late to prevent harm. Norms therefore degrade into symbolic
commitments rather than operative constraints.
Treaty-based governance attempts to formalize coordination through legally binding agreements.
While treaties can encode explicit limits, they depend on human interpretation, enforcement, and
adjudication. These processes scale poorly with action volume and are vulnerable to ambiguity, loop-
holes, and strategic reinterpretation. Moreover, treaties typically bind states rather than systems,
leaving open the question of how autonomous agents and private actors are constrained in practice.
Reputation-based and institutional oversight models emphasize transparency, audits, and account-
ability mechanisms. These approaches improve visibility but do not change admissibility conditions.
An action may be audited, criticized, or penalized after execution, yet the system provides no struc-
tural means to prevent recurrence. As capability increases, oversight becomes increasingly ceremo-
nial, producing reports rather than control.
By contrast, the architecture developed in this paper operates at a different layer of abstraction.
Instead of attempting to align incentives ex post, it enforces constraints ex ante. Instead of relying
on trust, it relies on verification. Instead of regulating actors, it regulates actions. This shift explains
why existing proposals struggle to address domination and chaos simultaneously. They attempt to
manage outcomes without constraining the processes that generate them.
Importantly, the proposed stack does not require global agreement on values, political systems,
or moral doctrines. It requires only agreement on formal invariants and verification procedures. This
minimalism is what allows coordination to scale across heterogeneous actors without collapsing into
either centralized authority or anarchic competition.
46
Unifying the Stack as a Plenum and Field Model
The full significance of the Spherepop-Polyxan-PlenumHub stack becomes apparent when viewed
as a unified plenum rather than as a collection of discrete components. A plenum, in the classical
sense, is a continuous medium that mediates interaction, propagation, and constraint. In this context,
the plenum is not physical but semantic and operational: a structured field in which actions, proofs,
and externalities propagate according to invariant laws.
Spherepop OS defines the temporal and semantic geometry of this plenum. Events are points in
the field, ordered by causality and irreversibility. Meaning arises not from instantaneous state but
from trajectories through event space. Consent defines forbidden regions within this field, carving
out volumes that actions may not enter.
Polyxan defines the local admissibility conditions within the plenum. Proof objects function as
field tensors that encode whether a proposed action satisfies the invariants at its point of insertion.
An action without a valid proof is analogous to a particle violating conservation laws; it cannot exist
within the field.
PlenumHub defines the global coupling between regions of the field. It ensures that interactions
28

across domains respect shared constraints and that externalities propagate through explicit channels
rather than leaking invisibly. Coordination emerges not from negotiation at every interaction but
from shared field structure.
Formally, let ℱdenote the plenum, and let actions be represented as localized excitations 𝑎∈ℱ.
Each excitation carries an externality vector X(𝑎) and a proof field 𝜋(𝑎). The dynamics of the system
are governed by admissibility equations of the form
ℒ(ℱ, 𝑎) = 0,
where ℒencodes semantic, safety, consent, and coordination invariants. Actions that violate these
equations are not evolved; they are excluded.
This field-theoretic perspective clarifies why domination and chaos are eliminated structurally.
Domination corresponds to singularities in which one excitation overwhelms the field, bypassing
invariants. Chaos corresponds to turbulence in which unbounded excitations accumulate external-
ities faster than constraints can dissipate them. In the proposed plenum, neither singularities nor
unbounded turbulence are admissible solutions. The field equations forbid them.
The narrow path is therefore not a balancing act performed by agents but a property of the field
itself. As long as invariants are enforced, trajectories remain within the stable region. Capability
growth corresponds to higher-energy excitations, not to violation of conservation laws.
47
Alignment Reconsidered
This unification allows a final reframing of alignment. Alignment is not primarily a property of agent
preferences, reward functions, or internal representations. It is a property of the environment in
which agents act. An aligned system is one in which misaligned actions are structurally inadmissible.
From this perspective, the alignment problem dissolves into an engineering problem: how to
design a plenum in which agency, consent, and coordination remain conserved quantities even as
intelligence accelerates. The Spherepop-Polyxan-PlenumHub stack offers one such design. It does
not promise utopia, consensus, or moral convergence. It promises something more modest and more
fundamental: that no actor, human or artificial, can unilaterally destroy the conditions under which
choice, cooperation, and meaning remain possible.
48
Closing Synthesis
The narrow path between domination and chaos is real, but it is not navigated by vigilance or virtue.
It is navigated by structure. Domination arises when power escapes constraint. Chaos arises when
constraint fails to scale. Both failures are consequences of architectures that treat consent, account-
ability, and externalities as secondary concerns.
By elevating these concepts to first-class invariants enforced through event sourcing, proof-carrying
admissibility, and shared coordination substrates, it is possible to design systems in which accelera-
29

tion does not imply loss of control. The future of artificial intelligence need not be decided by trust
or fear. It can be decided by design.

A
Appendix A: Formal Grammar of Event-Sourced and Proof-Carrying
Systems
This appendix presents a precise syntactic grammar for event-sourced, proof-carrying coordination
systems of the kind analyzed in the main text. The grammar is intentionally conservative. It specifies
the minimal structural requirements for well-formedness while remaining agnostic about semantic
interpretation, proof theory, or execution strategy. Its purpose is to define a common syntactic sub-
strate upon which the categorical and sheaf-theoretic semantics developed in subsequent appendices
may be imposed.
The grammar is expressed in Backus-Naur Form (BNF). Terminal symbols are written in type-
writer font, non-terminal symbols are enclosed in angle brackets, and metavariables range over syn-
tactic classes unless otherwise specified.
A.1
Lexical Primitives and Atomic Types
We assume a standard lexical layer sufficient to identify symbolic entities, scalar values, and Boolean
constants. These primitives are intentionally minimal, as higher-level structure is enforced composi-
tionally rather than lexically.
<Identifier> ::= <Letter> { <Letter> | <Digit> | "_" }
<Letter>
::= "A" | ... | "Z" | "a" | ... | "z"
<Digit>
::= "0" | ... | "9"
<Scalar>
::= <Integer> | <Float>
<Integer>
::= <Digit> { <Digit> }
<Float>
::= <Digit> { <Digit> } "." <Digit> { <Digit> }
<Bool>
::= "true" | "false"
Identifiers are treated as globally unique names within a given namespace. No syntactic distinc-
tion is made between identifiers denoting agents, actions, predicates, or specifications; such distinc-
tions are imposed semantically in later appendices.
A.2
Composite Value Structures
The grammar supports structured values for representing collections, vectors, and symbolic refer-
ences. These structures allow externality vectors, argument lists, and constraint payloads to be ex-
pressed uniformly.
<Value> ::= <Scalar>
| <Bool>
31

| <Identifier>
| <Set>
| <Vector>
<Set>
::= "{" [ <ValueList> ] "}"
<Vector> ::= "[" [ <ValueList> ] "]"
<ValueList> ::= <Value>
| <Value> "," <ValueList>
No ordering semantics are imposed on sets, while vectors are assumed to be ordered. The gram-
mar does not enforce type homogeneity within collections; typing constraints are deferred to the
specification layer.
A.3
Event Declarations
All system evolution is expressed through events. Events are the sole source of state change and are
irreducible. There is no notion of mutable state outside the event stream.
<Event> ::= "event" <Identifier> ":" <EventType> <EventPayload>
Each event has a unique identifier, a declared event type, and an associated payload.
A.4
Event Types
The grammar distinguishes event classes only to enforce minimal well-formedness conditions. The
semantics of these classes are defined structurally rather than procedurally.
<EventType> ::= "consent"
| "action"
| "transformation"
| "proof"
| "revocation"
The inclusion of a distinct revocation event type is essential. Revocation is not treated as
a negation of prior events but as a first-class event whose effects propagate through dependency
structure.
A.5
Event Payload Structure
Event payloads are structured records containing declarations. Declarations bind identifiers to values
within the local scope of the event.
32

<EventPayload> ::= "{" <DeclarationList> "}"
<DeclarationList> ::= <Declaration>
| <Declaration> "," <DeclarationList>
<Declaration> ::= <Identifier> "=" <Value>
No fixed schema is imposed on payloads at the grammar level. Schema enforcement is handled
by specification predicates and proofs.
A.6
Consent and Constraint Specifications
Consent is represented syntactically as a declarative constraint on semantic regions. These regions
are hierarchical and compositional.
<ConsentSpec> ::= "forbid" <SemanticRegion>
| "allow" <SemanticRegion>
<SemanticRegion> ::= <Identifier>
| <Identifier> "::" <SemanticRegion>
The use of a recursive region grammar enforces prefix-closure of semantic scopes. A constraint
on a region applies transitively to all subregions unless overridden by a more specific declaration.
A.7
Action Declarations
Actions are parameterized symbolic constructs. They do not imply execution; they are proposals
subject to admissibility judgment.
<Action> ::= "action" <Identifier> "(" [ <ArgumentList> ] ")"
<ArgumentList> ::= <Argument>
| <Argument> "," <ArgumentList>
<Argument> ::= <Identifier> ":" <Type>
The grammar intentionally separates action identity from admissibility. An action declaration
alone carries no authority.
A.8
Type and Specification Syntax
Types are treated syntactically as identifiers. Specifications are expressed as conjunctions of predi-
cates applied to arguments.
33

<Type> ::= <Identifier>
<Proof> ::= "proof" <Identifier> ":" <Specification>
<Specification> ::= <Predicate>
| <Predicate> "AND" <Specification>
<Predicate> ::= <Identifier> "(" [ <ArgumentList> ] ")"
Specifications are purely propositional at the syntactic level. The grammar does not privilege any
particular logic; it merely requires explicit enumeration of obligations.
A.9
Admissibility Judgments
Admissibility is the sole syntactic bridge between actions and proofs. No action is considered well-
formed for execution unless it appears within an admissibility judgment.
<Admissible> ::= <Action> "￿" <Proof>
An admissibility judgment is a syntactic claim that a given proof discharges all obligations re-
quired by the corresponding action. The grammar does not verify this claim; it only enforces that the
claim is explicit and structurally present.
A.10
Syntactic Invariants
The grammar enforces the following invariants:
First, all system evolution is event-based; there is no syntax for implicit state mutation. Second,
all authority is mediated through proofs; there is no syntax for unverified action. Third, revocation is
explicit and compositional; there is no silent erasure. Fourth, consent is declarative and hierarchical;
there is no ad hoc filtering.
These invariants are necessary but not sufficient for correctness. Their sufficiency is established
only when the grammar is interpreted through the categorical and sheaf-theoretic semantics devel-
oped in Appendices B through D.
B
Appendix B: Categorical Formulation of Events, Proofs, and Admissi-
bility
This appendix provides a categorical formalization of the event-sourced, proof-carrying coordination
system defined syntactically in Appendix A. The goal is not abstraction for its own sake, but the pre-
cise identification of the compositional structures that ensure scalability, auditability, and stability
34

under acceleration. Category theory is employed because it allows invariants to be expressed inde-
pendently of implementation details, while making explicit the conditions under which composition
is well-defined.
Throughout, we work in the setting of small categories. All constructions are internal to this
setting unless otherwise noted.
B.1
The Event Category
Let ℰbe a category whose objects are events as defined syntactically in Appendix A. Morphisms in
ℰrepresent causal precedence.
For events 𝑒1, 𝑒2 ∈Ob(ℰ), there exists a morphism
𝑒1 →𝑒2
if and only if event 𝑒1 causally precedes event 𝑒2.
We impose the following axioms:
First, identity: every event precedes itself. Second, transitivity: causal precedence composes.
Third, antisymmetry: if 𝑒1 →𝑒2 and 𝑒2 →𝑒1, then 𝑒1 = 𝑒2.
These axioms imply that ℰis a thin category, and therefore equivalent to a partially ordered
set. The absence of nontrivial automorphisms enforces irreversibility: events cannot be undone, only
followed by further events.
Acyclicity is enforced by the absence of non-identity endomorphisms, ensuring that no event
can be causally downstream of itself except trivially. This categorical property formalizes the event-
sourced nature of the system.
B.2
The Action Category
Let 𝒜be a category whose objects are action declarations. Morphisms in 𝒜represent lawful transfor-
mations of actions, such as refinement, parameter instantiation, or sequential composition, provided
such transformations preserve required specifications.
Composition in 𝒜is partial: two actions may be composable only if the output context of the first
is compatible with the input context of the second. This partiality reflects the fact that not all actions
may be sequenced meaningfully.
The identity morphism on an action corresponds to the trivial refinement of that action.
B.3
The Proof Category
Let 𝒫be a category whose objects are proof artifacts. A proof artifact is a structured justification
discharging one or more specifications. Morphisms in 𝒫represent proof refinement, extension, or
weakening, provided that discharged specifications remain satisfied.
Unlike 𝒜, the category 𝒫is generally not thin. Multiple distinct proofs may discharge the same
specification, and morphisms between proofs capture relationships such as proof reuse, abstraction,
35

or specialization.
B.4
The Specification Category
Let 𝒮be a category whose objects are specifications. A specification is understood as a formal obli-
gation or invariant that may be required of an action and discharged by a proof.
Morphisms in 𝒮represent implication or refinement relations between specifications. If there
exists a morphism
𝜙1 →𝜙2,
then satisfaction of 𝜙1 implies satisfaction of 𝜙2.
This ordering allows specifications to be composed and compared structurally.
B.5
Functorial Structure
There exist two canonical functors connecting these categories.
First, a functor
𝐻∶𝒜→𝒮
that assigns to each action the specification it requires. This functor formalizes the notion that actions
impose obligations on the system.
Second, a functor
𝐺∶𝒫→𝒮
that assigns to each proof the specification it discharges. This functor formalizes the notion that
proofs certify satisfaction of obligations.
These functors are required to be compatible with composition: refining an action refines its
required specification, and refining a proof refines the specification it discharges.
B.6
Admissibility as a Pullback
Admissible actions are defined categorically as the pullback of 𝐻and 𝐺over 𝒮. Concretely, we define
a category 𝒜adm by the pullback square
𝒜adm = 𝒜×𝒮𝒫.
An object of 𝒜adm is a pair (𝑎, 𝑝) such that
𝐻(𝑎) = 𝐺(𝑝).
That is, the specification required by the action is exactly the specification discharged by the proof.
Morphisms in 𝒜adm are pairs of morphisms in 𝒜and 𝒫that commute with the pullback condition.
This ensures that refinement of admissible actions preserves admissibility.
36

B.7
Compositionality of Admissible Actions
The pullback construction guarantees compositional closure. If (𝑎1, 𝑝1) and (𝑎2, 𝑝2) are admissible
and composable, then their composition (𝑎2 ∘𝑎1, 𝑝2 ∘𝑝1) is admissible provided the composed proof
discharges the composed specification.
This property is critical under acceleration. As action volume increases, admissibility checking
remains local and compositional rather than global and procedural.
B.8
Faithful Embedding of Behavior-Based Systems
Let ℬ⊂𝒜be the full subcategory of behavior-aligned actions, that is, actions whose correctness is
inferred post hoc from observed behavior rather than proven ex ante.
There exists a faithful functor
𝐼∶ℬ↪𝒜adm,
which embeds behavior-based actions into the proof-carrying system by pairing them with trivial or
opaque proofs.
However, there exists no functor
𝒜adm →ℬ
that preserves safety invariants. This asymmetry establishes a strict expressive dominance: proof-
carrying governance can represent all behavior-based systems, but not vice versa.
B.9
Implications for Control and Scaling
The categorical formulation makes explicit why proof-carrying systems scale under acceleration. Ad-
missibility is not a global property computed over entire histories; it is a local property enforced
by pullback structure. As a result, increases in action throughput do not increase the complexity of
admissibility checking beyond the complexity of individual proofs.
This structural property underlies the main text's claim that domination and chaos are eliminated
not by monitoring outcomes, but by constraining composition itself.
C
Appendix C: Sheaf-Theoretic Interpretation of Consent, Externalities,
and Coordination
This appendix develops a sheaf-theoretic semantics for the event-sourced, proof-carrying system in-
troduced in Appendices A and B. The purpose of this interpretation is to make precise how local
admissibility conditions compose into global coherence, and how failures of such composition corre-
spond exactly to negative externalities, coordination breakdowns, and pathological attractors.
Sheaf theory is employed because it provides a mathematically precise language for reasoning
about locality, compatibility, and gluing. These notions are central to the system under consideration:
37

actions are proposed locally, consent is expressed contextually, and coordination requires that locally
admissible actions remain globally consistent.
C.1
The Semantic Base Space
Let 𝑋be a topological space whose points represent semantic contexts. A semantic context is defined
as a minimal situation in which the admissibility of an action can be evaluated. Examples include a
specific user's content environment, a particular subsystem of an infrastructure, or a localized inter-
action domain within a multipolar coordination setting.
The topology on 𝑋encodes refinement of context. An open set 𝑈⊆𝑋represents a region of
semantic coherence: a set of contexts within which the same consent constraints, specifications, and
admissibility judgments apply. If 𝑉⊆𝑈, then 𝑉is a refinement of 𝑈, corresponding to a more specific
or constrained context.
The topological structure is not assumed to be Hausdorff or metrizable. Only the axioms necessary
for sheaf theory are required. In particular, the existence of arbitrary unions and finite intersections
of open sets is sufficient.
C.2
Presheaf of Admissible Actions
Define a presheaf
ℱ∶𝒪(𝑋)op →Set
on the category of open sets of 𝑋. For each open set 𝑈⊆𝑋, the set ℱ(𝑈) consists of all actions that
are admissible within semantic region 𝑈.
Restriction maps
𝜌𝑈,𝑉∶ℱ(𝑈) →ℱ(𝑉)
for 𝑉⊆𝑈
model contextual refinement. An action admissible in a broader context may or may not remain
admissible when additional constraints are imposed.
The presheaf axioms enforce that restriction is identity-preserving and compositional.
C.3
Consent as Subsheaf Construction
Consent declarations impose exclusions on admissible actions. Formally, consent is represented by a
subsheaf
ℱconsent ⊆ℱ.
For each open set 𝑈, the set ℱconsent(𝑈) consists of those actions in ℱ(𝑈) that do not violate any
consent constraint applicable within 𝑈.
The subsheaf condition ensures that consent constraints are monotone under refinement: if an
action is forbidden in a broader context, it remains forbidden in all refined contexts. Conversely,
allowances may be introduced only by moving to larger contexts or by explicit revocation events.
38

This formalizes the durability and non-locality of consent boundaries emphasized in the main
text.
C.4
Externalities as Failures of Gluing
The defining property of a sheaf is the gluing condition. Given an open cover {𝑈𝑖} of an open set 𝑈, a
family of sections
𝑎𝑖∈ℱ(𝑈𝑖)
that agree on all overlaps 𝑈𝑖∩𝑈𝑗must glue uniquely to a section 𝑎∈ℱ(𝑈).
In the present framework, negative externalities correspond exactly to failures of this gluing con-
dition. A family of locally admissible actions may fail to glue because their combined effects violate
a global invariant, such as an externality budget, safety constraint, or coordination requirement.
Such failures are not semantic accidents; they are structural obstructions. The obstruction is
global even if no local violation is visible.
C.5
Cocycle Conditions and Cumulative Harm
More formally, consider a cover {𝑈𝑖} and a family {𝑎𝑖} of locally admissible actions. Compatibility
on overlaps expresses pairwise non-interference. However, cumulative harm arises when higher-
order compatibility fails: triple overlaps, or the total effect over the union 𝑈, violate a constraint not
expressible at the level of any single 𝑈𝑖.
This failure corresponds to a nontrivial cocycle in the Čech cohomology of the presheaf. The
cocycle represents a latent externality that is invisible locally but unavoidable globally.
Thus negative externalities are identified with cohomological obstructions to global sections.
C.6
PlenumHub as a Global Section Enforcer
PlenumHub is interpreted sheaf-theoretically as enforcing the sheaf condition by construction. Only
those families of local actions that admit a global section are executable.
Formally, PlenumHub restricts the system to the sheafification
ℱ+
of the presheaf ℱ. Actions that remain presheaf-local but fail to sheafify are rejected prior to execu-
tion.
This guarantees that coordination is not emergent or negotiated post hoc. It is enforced by the
topology of admissibility itself.
C.7
Domination and Chaos in Sheaf-Theoretic Terms
Domination corresponds to singular global sections that ignore local restrictions. In sheaf-theoretic
language, these are sections that exist only because restriction maps are bypassed or disabled. Such
39

sections cannot exist in a true sheaf.
Chaos corresponds to families of locally admissible sections that cannot be glued due to unresolved
cocycle obstructions. In the absence of sheaf enforcement, such families accumulate and interact de-
structively.
By enforcing sheaf conditions mechanically, the system excludes both pathologies. Only globally
coherent sections are admitted, and all admissible local actions must participate in a consistent global
structure.
C.8
Stability Under Refinement
A crucial consequence of the sheaf-theoretic formulation is stability under refinement. As seman-
tic contexts become more detailed or constraints become more specific, the admissible action space
shrinks monotonically, but coherence is preserved.
This property underlies the system's ability to remain stable under increasing intelligence and
complexity. Refinement does not introduce inconsistency; it merely excludes previously admissible
trajectories that are no longer coherent under stricter constraints.
D
Appendix D: Structural Elimination of Pathological Attractors
This appendix completes the formal foundation by demonstrating, at the level of system structure
rather than agent behavior, the elimination of the two pathological attractors analyzed in the main
text: domination and chaos. The argument synthesizes the syntactic constraints of Appendix A, the
categorical compositionality of Appendix B, and the sheaf-theoretic coherence conditions of Appendix
C.
The central claim is that domination and chaos are not merely unlikely under the proposed ar-
chitecture; they are structurally inadmissible. They correspond to objects or trajectories that cannot
exist within the formal system defined by admissibility, composition, and gluing.
D.1
Attractors as Structural Fixed Points
We begin by formalizing the notion of an attractor in the present context. Let 𝒯denote the space
of admissible trajectories, where a trajectory is a finite or infinite sequence of events drawn from the
event category ℰand whose actions are objects of the admissibility category 𝒜adm.
An attractor is defined as a subset 𝐴⊆𝒯such that, under refinement of context, increase in ca-
pability, or extension of history, trajectories generically evolve toward 𝐴unless prevented by explicit
constraints.
The claim of this appendix is that, in the proposed system, the subsets corresponding to domina-
tion and chaos are empty. There exist no admissible trajectories exhibiting either property.
40

D.2
Domination as Structural Singularity
Domination is characterized by the unilateral execution of actions whose effects cannot be contested,
audited, or constrained by other actors or by the system itself. Structurally, domination requires the
existence of at least one of the following:
First, an action executed without an associated proof discharging its required specifications. Sec-
ond, an action whose proof cannot be inspected or verified by other participants. Third, an action
that bypasses consent or externality constraints due to privileged status of the actor.
Each of these conditions corresponds to a violation of structural invariants.
By Appendix A, no action is well-formed for execution unless it appears in an admissibility judg-
ment pairing it with a proof. By Appendix B, admissibility is defined categorically as a pullback; there
is no morphism admitting an action without a corresponding proof object. By Appendix C, global ex-
ecution requires compatibility with all relevant local constraints; singular sections are excluded.
Therefore, domination would require the existence of a morphism in 𝒜adm whose projection to
𝒫is undefined or opaque. No such morphism exists.
D.3
Lemma: Non-Existence of Uncertified Actions
Formally, let 𝑎∈Ob(𝒜) be an action. Suppose there exists a trajectory in which 𝑎is executed. Then
there exists a proof object 𝑝∈Ob(𝒫) such that (𝑎, 𝑝) ∈Ob(𝒜adm).
Proof. This follows directly from the definition of 𝒜adm as a pullback. Objects of 𝒜adm are pre-
cisely such pairs. There is no inclusion of 𝒜into the execution semantics independent of 𝒜adm. □
Thus domination, understood as action beyond contestation, is structurally impossible.
D.4
Chaos as Failure of Global Coherence
Chaos is characterized by a multipolar regime in which actors follow locally admissible strategies
whose aggregate effects undermine shared invariants. Structurally, chaos requires the existence of a
family of locally admissible actions whose combined execution violates a global constraint, such as
an externality bound or safety invariant.
In the sheaf-theoretic formulation of Appendix C, this corresponds precisely to a failure of the
gluing condition. Locally admissible sections exist, but they do not glue to a global section.
D.5
Lemma: Non-Existence of Non-Glueable Executable Families
Let {𝑈𝑖} be an open cover of a semantic region 𝑈⊆𝑋, and let 𝑎𝑖∈ℱ(𝑈𝑖) be locally admissible
actions. Suppose the family {𝑎𝑖} fails to glue to a global section in ℱ(𝑈). Then the execution of {𝑎𝑖} is
inadmissible.
Proof. By construction, PlenumHub restricts execution to the sheafification ℱ+. Only families
admitting a global section are executable. Non-glueable families are rejected ex ante. □
Thus chaos, understood as cumulative incoherence, is excluded structurally rather than mitigated
dynamically.
41

D.6
Externalities and the Closure of the Argument
The essential bridge between domination and chaos is the treatment of negative externalities. Dom-
ination corresponds to unbounded externality imposition by a single actor; chaos corresponds to
bounded local externalities whose accumulation is unbounded globally.
By requiring explicit externality accounting at the level of admissibility, and by enforcing gluing
conditions across contexts, both modes of failure are eliminated simultaneously.
No actor may impose unbounded externalities unilaterally, because admissibility requires proof
against global invariants. No collection of actors may impose unbounded externalities cumulatively,
because non-glueable action families are rejected.
D.7
Stability Under Acceleration
A critical concern addressed in the main text is whether these guarantees persist as system capability
accelerates. Structurally, acceleration increases the density of proposed actions but does not alter the
admissibility criteria.
Because admissibility is local, compositional, and proof-based, the cost of verification scales with
proof complexity rather than with action volume. The categorical and sheaf-theoretic constructions
remain invariant under increased throughput.
Thus neither domination nor chaos can re-emerge as attractors under acceleration. They are not
unstable equilibria awaiting perturbation; they are absent states in the system's phase space.
D.8
Conclusion
The elimination of domination and chaos is achieved not through balance, negotiation, or trust, but
through structure. By enforcing event-sourced irreversibility, proof-carrying admissibility, categori-
cal compositionality, and sheaf-theoretic coherence, the system defines a space of admissible trajec-
tories from which pathological attractors are excluded by construction.
This completes the formal foundation underlying the arguments of the main text. The final ap-
pendices give formalizations in lean.

Appendix E: Lean Formalizations of Event-Sourced Admissibility, Proof-
Carrying Actions, and Externality Constraints
This appendix provides Lean formalizations corresponding to the core structures used in the manuscript:
event-sourced histories, consent as admissibility constraints, proof-carrying actions, and externality-
bounded coordination. The code is written to be readable and modular, using standard Lean 4 idioms.
It is intended as a schematic formalization suitable for refinement into a fully mechanized develop-
ment.

E.5 Bidirectional Proof Topology as Dependency Tracking
We capture the bidirectional link property by representing a proof object as a reusable lemma and
defining a dependency relation from proofs to certified actions.
-- A reusable proof artifact is modeled as a theorem/lemma object.
-- For formal dependency tracking, we model it as a predicate that implies SpecOK
structure ProofArtifact (￿s : SpecSet) where
witness : ∀a : Action, SpecOK ￿s a →True
-- Placeholder for a richer artifact
-- Forward link: any certificate contains a proof (Lean term) of Admissible.
def forwardLink {Cs ￿s h} (cert : Certificate Cs ￿s h) : Admissible Cs ￿s h cert.a
cert.ok
-- Backward link: given a set of certificates, we can collect those that depend o
-- In Lean, dependency is syntactic; here we model it semantically.
def DependsOn (￿s : SpecSet) (a : Action) : Prop := SpecOK ￿s a
def BackwardImage (￿s : SpecSet) (A : Set Action) : Set Action :=
{a | a ∈A ￿DependsOn ￿s a}
This semantic abstraction is adequate for the manuscript's claim: revocation corresponds to chang-
ing Φ or its trusted axioms so that previously derivable proofs no longer typecheck, thereby invali-
dating dependent certificates.
E.6
E.6 Externality Vectors and Budgets
Externalities are modeled as cost functions per dimension with per-action and cumulative constraints.
-- Externality measure: for each action and dimension, a cost.
constant extCost : Action →ExtDim →Cost

-- A per-dimension budget
abbrev Budget := ExtDim →Cost
-- An action respects the budget if all its dimensional costs are bounded.
def ExtOK (B : Budget) (a : Action) : Prop :=
∀d : ExtDim, extCost a d ￿ₖ B d
-- Add an externality constraint to the specification set.
def ExtSpec (B : Budget) : Specification := fun a => ExtOK B a
For cumulative constraints, we model a ledger and require that each admitted action preserves
global boundedness.
-- A ledger is a mapping from dimension to cumulative cost.
abbrev Ledger := ExtDim →Cost
-- Ledger update rule after admitting an action.
constant addCost : Cost →Cost →Cost

def PreservesLedger (B : Budget) (L : Ledger) (a : Action) : Prop :=
LedgerOK B L →LedgerOK B (ledgerUpdate L a)
E.7
E.7 PlenumHub-Style Multipolar Interaction as Joint Policy Satisfaction
We model a hub-mediated interaction between two agents as an action that must satisfy both agents'
policies and hub policies. Policies are specifications parameterized by agent.
-- Agent policy: a specification predicate on actions.
abbrev Policy := Agent →Specification
-- Hub policy: a specification predicate (not agent-indexed).

abbrev HubPolicy := Specification
-- Joint admissibility for interaction action between agents i and j.

E.8
E.8 Structural Prevention of Defection via Externality Constraints
We formalize the key claim: actions that attempt to externalize beyond bounds are inadmissible, there-
fore the defection advantage is eliminated at the admissibility layer.
-- A defection action is one that violates externality budget.
def Defection (B : Budget) (a : Action) : Prop := ¬ ExtOK B a

E.9 Domination and Chaos as Non-Admissible Trajectory Properties
A full mechanization of domination and chaos requires a system dynamics model. Here we state
the core structural form: trajectories are sequences of certified actions; inadmissible actions cannot
appear. Domination corresponds to unilateral constraint bypass; chaos corresponds to cumulative
externality overflow. Both are excluded by construction.
-- A trajectory is a sequence of certified actions under evolving histories.
structure Step (Cs : ConsentSet) (￿s : SpecSet) where

abbrev Trajectory (Cs : ConsentSet) (￿s : SpecSet) := List (Step Cs ￿s)

E.10 Notes on Mechanization Strategy
A complete mechanization proceeds by (i) instantiating specifications as concrete predicates, (ii) en-
coding consent constraints as monotone admissibility functions over histories, (iii) defining hub poli-
cies to include externality budgets and safety invariants, and (iv) proving that trajectories built from
certificates cannot realize domination or chaos properties. The key is that the relevant invariants
are stated as specifications and therefore become proof obligations, rather than being inferred from
behavior.

Appendix F: Lean Development with Operational Semantics, Ordered
Monoids, Trajectory Validity, and Inductive Safety Proofs
This appendix refines Appendix E by replacing schematic placeholders with a concrete, inductive
development. We formalize (i) an ordered commutative monoid of costs, (ii) a ledger update semantics,
(iii) trajectory validity as an inductive predicate, and (iv) theorems showing that externality overflow
and constraint-bypass actions cannot occur in valid trajectories. The development remains abstract in
48

the sense that it does not commit to a particular SMT backend or proof-carrying code format; rather,
it makes precise the structural logic that the manuscript relies upon.
F.1

We require costs to form a commutative monoid equipped with a preorder compatible with addition.
This is the minimal algebraic structure for externality accounting.

We model specifications as predicates on actions, consent as a history-indexed predicate, and admis-
sibility as the conjunction of consent and specification satisfaction.

F.3
F.3 Externality Ledger Semantics and Budget Constraints
We define externality dimensions, a cost function per dimension, a ledger as a function from dimen-
sions to costs, and an update rule that accumulates costs additively.
constant ExtDim : Type
constant extCost : Action →ExtDim →Cost
abbrev Budget := ExtDim →Cost

def ExtOK (B : Budget) (a : Action) : Prop :=
∀d : ExtDim, extCost a d ￿ₖ B d
50

-- Two externality styles: per-action boundedness and cumulative ledger boundedn
-- The manuscript's stronger claim is obtained via cumulative boundedness.
def PreservesLedger (B : Budget) (L : Ledger) (a : Action) : Prop :=
LedgerOK B L →LedgerOK B (ledgerUpdate L a)
F.4
F.4 Policy Encoding: Hub Policy Requires Ledger Preservation
PlenumHub is modeled as requiring that each admitted action preserve a shared externality ledger
bound. This is a structural externality internalization constraint.
def HubPolicy (B : Budget) (L : Ledger) : Specification :=
fun a => PreservesLedger B L a
F.5
F.5 Operational Semantics of Steps and Trajectory Validity
A trajectory is a sequence of steps. Each step carries a history, a ledger state, and a certificate whose
admissibility must include the hub's ledger-preservation policy at that step. Validity is defined induc-
tively, forcing the ledger to remain within bounds at every step.
structure Step (Cs : ConsentSet) (￿s : SpecSet) where
h
: History
L
: Ledger
cert : Certificate Cs ￿s h
abbrev Trajectory (Cs : ConsentSet) (￿s : SpecSet) := List (Step Cs ￿s)
-- A predicate stating that a step's certificate includes the hub policy at ledge
def StepHasHubPolicy (Cs : ConsentSet) (￿s : SpecSet) (B : Budget) (s : Step Cs ￿s
(HubPolicy B s.L) ∈￿s
-- Inductive validity: start from an initial ledger within budget; each step must
-- (i) have a ledger within budget, (ii) include the hub policy, and
-- (iii) preserve the ledger to the next step.
inductive ValidTrajectory (Cs : ConsentSet) (￿s : SpecSet) (B : Budget) : Ledger
| nil (L0 : Ledger) :
LedgerOK B L0 →
ValidTrajectory Cs ￿s B L0 []
| cons (L0 : Ledger) (s : Step Cs ￿s) (ts : Trajectory Cs ￿s) :
LedgerOK B L0 →
s.L = L0 →
51

StepHasHubPolicy Cs ￿s B s →
-- the certificate must entail hub policy satisfaction for the action
(let a := s.cert.act
let okSpecs := s.cert.ok.right
(HubPolicy B L0) a) →
-- next ledger is the updated ledger
ValidTrajectory Cs ￿s B (ledgerUpdate L0 s.cert.act) ts →
ValidTrajectory Cs ￿s B L0 (s :: ts)
The above definition makes the hub constraint causally operative: ledger preservation is checked
at each step, and the next state is defined by the ledger update rule. Valid trajectories therefore cannot
accumulate externalities beyond the declared budget.
F.6
F.6 Main Theorem I: No Externality Overflow in Valid Trajectories
We formalize overflow as the existence of a step whose ledger violates the budget. The theorem shows
that overflow cannot occur.
def Overflow (B : Budget) (L : Ledger) : Prop := ¬ LedgerOK B L
theorem no_overflow_in_valid
(Cs : ConsentSet) (￿s : SpecSet) (B : Budget) :
∀(L0 : Ledger) (ts : Trajectory Cs ￿s),
ValidTrajectory Cs ￿s B L0 ts →
∀s ∈ts, ¬ Overflow B s.L := by
intro L0 ts hValid

simpa [hEqL] using hOK)
52

| tail hsInTail =>
-- apply IH to tail
have : ¬ Overflow B s'.L := ih s' hsInTail
exact this
This theorem is the formal core of the manuscript's externality claim: cumulative harm is pre-
vented because ledger boundedness is an invariant of valid trajectories.
F.7
F.7 Constraint Bypass and the Impossibility of Uncertified Actions
Domination, in its structural form, requires bypassing the admissibility gate. In the formal system,
bypass corresponds to an action appearing in the evolution without a certificate. We model a trace as
the list of actions extracted from a trajectory and prove that every action in a valid trajectory has an
admissibility proof.
def ActionsOf (Cs : ConsentSet) (￿s : SpecSet) (ts : Trajectory Cs ￿s) : List Acti
ts.map (fun s => s.cert.act)
theorem every_action_certified
(Cs : ConsentSet) (￿s : SpecSet) (B : Budget) :

∀a ∈ActionsOf Cs ￿s ts,
∃(h : History) (L : Ledger), ∃(cert : Certificate Cs ￿s h),
cert.act = a ￿Admissible Cs ￿s h a := by
intro L0 ts hValid

have hAdm : Admissible Cs ￿s s.h s.cert.act := s.cert.ok
53

simpa [hHead] using hAdm
| inr hTailIn =>
exact ih a hTailIn
This theorem expresses the non-bypass property: any realized action is necessarily backed by a
proof of admissibility. Structural domination requires an actor to act without being subject to con-
straints; this is ruled out by the construction of trajectories.
F.8
F.8 Eliminating the Defection Advantage with Ledger Preservation
To connect back to the chaos attractor, we show that actions that would cause immediate ledger over-
flow cannot be admitted at any valid step. This is stronger than a per-action bound; it is a cumulative
guarantee.
def CausesOverflowNext (B : Budget) (L : Ledger) (a : Action) : Prop :=
Overflow B (ledgerUpdate L a)
theorem no_overflow_causing_action_admitted
(Cs : ConsentSet) (￿s : SpecSet) (B : Budget) :
∀(L0 : Ledger) (s : Step Cs ￿s),
LedgerOK B L0 →
s.L = L0 →
StepHasHubPolicy Cs ￿s B s →
(let a := s.cert.act; (HubPolicy B L0) a) →
¬ CausesOverflowNext B L0 s.cert.act := by
intro L0 s hOK hEqL hHas hubSat
unfold CausesOverflowNext Overflow
intro hOv
-- By hub policy satisfaction, ledgerUpdate preserves LedgerOK, contradiction
have hPres : PreservesLedger B L0 s.cert.act := hubSat
have : LedgerOK B (ledgerUpdate L0 s.cert.act) := hPres hOK
exact hOv this
This theorem formalizes the manuscript's key externality mechanism: defection by externality
overflow is not merely punishable; it is inadmissible.
F.9
F.9 Notes on Completing the Domination/Chaos Attractor Proof in Lean
The manuscript's attractor elimination result can be fully mechanized by defining domination and
chaos as properties of trajectories. A domination attempt is modeled as the existence of an action
in the evolution that is not certified or that violates a non-negotiable hub invariant. A chaos regime
is modeled as the existence of a trajectory whose ledger exceeds budget or whose policies become
54

inconsistent. The theorems above already provide the two core lemmas needed: (i) all actions are
certified, hence bypass is impossible, and (ii) ledger overflow cannot occur in valid trajectories, hence
cumulative externality escalation is structurally prevented.
To capture multipolar interaction explicitly, one extends Action to include agent parameters
and composes agent policies conjunctively within SpecSet. The proofs proceed by induction on
ValidTrajectory and rely only on monotonicity and compositionality of specifications. The
critical point remains unchanged: the system's evolution is restricted to trajectories whose steps are
admissible, and admissibility is defined in terms of proof-checkable invariants.

Appendix G: Runnable Lean 4 Formalization with Concrete Costs
This appendix provides a concrete, executable Lean 4 development instantiating the abstract frame-
work of the previous appendices. Costs are natural numbers, externalities accumulate additively, and
all invariants are proved using Lean's standard library. This appendix demonstrates that the elimina-
tion of domination and chaos is not merely schematic but mechanically verified.
