Coherence Before Engagement:
An Architecture for Persistent Meaning in Digital Systems
Flyxion
January 6, 2026
Abstract
Contemporary social media platforms have become foundational infrastructure for public dis-
course, knowledge exchange, and collective sense-making. Despite their scale and pervasiveness,
these systems exhibit persistent and well-documented pathologies: semantic drift, performative
identity, misinformation amplification, and the erosion of interpersonal trust. This paper argues
that these failures are not the result of deficient moderation policies or misaligned recommenda-
tion algorithms, but instead arise from fundamental architectural commitments embedded in feed-
based, engagement-optimized platforms.
We present a coherence-first alternative to social media grounded in a formal semantic sub-
strate. In this architecture, the primary unit of interaction is not a post or message, but a structured
semantic object with explicit modality requirements, provenance, and bounded entropy. Identity
is defined by persistence and traceable transformation history rather than visibility or popularity
metrics. Evolution of meaning proceeds through typed, entropy-bounded transformations that
preserve coherence over time.
Rather than proposing incremental reforms to existing platforms, this work outlines a categori-
cally different model of social computation. We formalize core concepts, analyze their information-
theoretic properties, provide concrete instantiations, and examine scalability, governance, and im-
plementation considerations. The result is a principled framework for large-scale digital discourse
in which trust and understanding emerge as stable structural properties rather than ephemeral sig-
nals.

A Motivating Example
Consider a long-running public discussion concerning a scientific or policy question. On contempo-
rary social media, this discussion fragments into thousands of posts, responses, and quote-reposts,
each optimized for visibility at the moment of publication. Corrections are rarely propagated with the
same reach as initial claims, and revisions are indistinguishable from contradictions. Participants are
rewarded for novelty and provocation rather than sustained engagement with the evolving substance
of the topic.
In contrast, a coherence-first system represents the discussion as a small number of persistent
semantic objects. Claims, evidence, counterarguments, and revisions are attached to these objects
through typed transformations with explicit provenance. The discussion evolves by accumulation and
refinement rather than displacement. Visibility is decoupled from immediacy, and trust accrues through
demonstrated consistency over time.
The remainder of this paper develops the formal and practical implications of adopting such an
architecture.

Related Work
The proposal advanced in this paper intersects multiple lines of prior work, including commercial so-
cial media platforms, collaborative knowledge systems, federated networks, and academic research
in computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), human-computer interaction (HCI), semantic web
technologies, and knowledge representation. This section situates the coherence-first approach rela-
tive to these domains and clarifies how it differs from both existing platforms and incremental reform
efforts.
1.1
Feed-Based Social Media Platforms
Dominant social media platforms such as Twitter/X, Reddit, and Facebook share a common architec-
tural pattern: content is produced as discrete posts and delivered to users via feeds ordered by recency,
2

engagement, or learned relevance. Identity is represented by profiles augmented with follower counts,
karma, or verification markers. Visibility and influence are mediated by algorithmic ranking systems
that prioritize interaction volume over semantic structure.
Extensive empirical work has documented the consequences of these design choices. Studies in
CSCW and computational social science have shown that engagement-based ranking amplifies emo-
tionally charged content, accelerates polarization, and privileges novelty over correction or synthesis.
Once introduced, misinformation persists even after retraction, as corrective posts rarely propagate
through the same network paths as the original claims. These phenomena are not anomalies but stable
equilibria of attention-optimized systems.
Incremental reforms within this paradigm have focused on moderation, labeling, or algorithmic
adjustment. While such interventions may reduce specific harms, they do not alter the underlying
dynamics produced by feed ordering and popularity metrics. The coherence-first approach diverges
by rejecting the feed as a primary organizing structure and eliminating engagement metrics entirely,
rather than attempting to refine their use.
1.2
Community Aggregation and Forum Systems
Platforms such as Reddit and Stack Exchange introduce additional structure through topic segmenta-
tion, threaded discussion, and reputation systems. These designs mitigate some issues associated with
unstructured feeds by localizing discourse and enabling deeper engagement within bounded communi-
ties. However, they continue to rely on post-level interaction and popularity signals, such as upvotes,
karma, and accepted answers.
Research on online forums highlights tradeoffs inherent in these systems. Reputation mechanisms
can incentivize expertise and sustained participation, but they also encourage strategic behavior and
gatekeeping. Threads remain ephemeral, with discussions reset as new posts displace older ones.
Knowledge accumulates unevenly and often requires manual curation or external summarization to
remain accessible.
The coherence-first model differs by treating discussion topics as persistent semantic objects rather
than ephemeral threads. Contributions do not compete for visibility within a feed or forum, but attach
directly to evolving objects whose structure constrains how discourse unfolds.
1.3
Federated and Decentralized Networks
Federated platforms such as Mastodon and Bluesky aim to address governance and moderation con-
cerns by decentralizing control. These systems distribute authority across instances or protocols while
preserving familiar social media interactions, including posts, feeds, and follower relationships.
Decentralization addresses important issues of platform control and censorship but leaves the se-
mantic architecture largely unchanged. Feed-based delivery, engagement signals, and performative
identity remain central. As a result, many of the same coherence and trust problems observed in cen-
tralized platforms reappear in federated settings.
The coherence-first approach is orthogonal to decentralization. While compatible with distributed
deployment, it targets the semantic and computational substrate rather than the ownership or gover-
3

nance layer. Decentralization without semantic constraints risks replicating existing failure modes at
smaller scales.
1.4
Newsletter and Long-Form Publishing Platforms
Platforms such as Substack emphasize long-form content and subscription-based distribution, offer-
ing an alternative to short-form social media. By decoupling revenue from engagement metrics and
emphasizing author-reader relationships, these systems encourage slower, more deliberate communi-
cation.
However, long-form publishing platforms retain a broadcast-oriented model. Content is still pro-
duced as discrete artifacts, revisions are limited, and discourse occurs largely through comments or
external channels. Semantic relationships between texts are implicit rather than formally represented.
The coherence-first model generalizes beyond long-form publishing by supporting structured evo-
lution of ideas across modalities and time, rather than privileging a single medium or authorial voice.
1.5
Collaborative Knowledge Systems
Wikis represent an early attempt to support cumulative knowledge construction. By allowing collab-
orative editing of shared documents, wikis reduce fragmentation and encourage synthesis. Version
histories provide a limited form of provenance, enabling reversion and accountability.
Despite these strengths, wikis impose a monolithic document structure that struggles to accommo-
date disagreement, parallel perspectives, and ongoing revision. Semantic relationships between pages
are informal, and conflicts are resolved socially rather than mechanically. Empirical studies of wiki
governance document persistent tensions between openness and control.
Version control systems such as Git provide more rigorous provenance tracking and support branch-
ing and merging of parallel developments. These systems excel at managing structured artifacts such
as source code but are ill-suited to general discourse. Line-based diffs and merge conflicts capture
syntactic changes rather than semantic ones, and non-textual modalities are poorly supported.
The coherence-first approach draws inspiration from both wikis and version control while address-
ing their limitations. It generalizes provenance and branching to semantic objects across modalities and
introduces entropy-bounded merging to preserve meaning rather than syntax.
1.6
Semantic Web and Knowledge Representation
The semantic web and knowledge representation communities have long sought to formalize meaning
through ontologies, graphs, and logical inference. Technologies such as RDF, OWL, and knowledge
graphs provide expressive frameworks for representing structured information and relationships.
While powerful, these systems typically require significant upfront formalization and expertise.
They are optimized for machine reasoning rather than human discourse and lack mechanisms for incre-
mental, conversational evolution of meaning. As a result, they have seen limited adoption as substrates
for everyday communication.
4

The coherence-first architecture occupies a middle ground. It adopts formal structure where nec-
essary to preserve coherence but does not require full logical formalization of all content. Semantic
constraints operate locally and incrementally, allowing discourse to remain flexible while preventing
unbounded drift.
1.7
Architectural Alternatives versus Incremental Reform
A recurring theme in prior work is the attempt to repair social media pathologies through incremental
changes: improved moderation, transparency tools, algorithmic tweaks, or decentralized governance.
While valuable, these efforts accept the core primitives of posts, feeds, and engagement metrics as given.
This paper advances a different stance. It argues that these primitives are the source of systemic
failure and must be replaced rather than refined. The coherence-first approach constitutes an archi-
tectural alternative, redefining the units of communication, identity, and relevance at the substrate
level.
In doing so, it aligns with a growing body of research emphasizing the importance of structural
constraints in shaping collective behavior. Rather than optimizing outcomes within a fixed architecture,
it seeks to redesign the architecture itself to make certain failure modes structurally impossible.

Theoretical Foundations
This section develops the formal foundations of a coherence-first semantic substrate. We introduce
semantic objects as the primary units of meaning, define entropy-bounded evolution as a constraint
on semantic transformation, specify modality requirements, and formalize provenance as a graph-
structured invariant. Together, these elements define a computational framework in which meaning
can evolve without unbounded drift.
2.1
Semantic Objects
We begin by defining the fundamental unit of representation.
Definition 1 (Semantic Object). A semantic object is a structured entity
σ = (I, M, C, P, E)
where I is an immutable identity, M is a finite set of required modalities, C is a partial function assigning
content to modalities, P is a provenance graph recording the derivation history of σ, and E is a non-
negative real number representing the semantic entropy of the object.
Intuitively, a semantic object represents a unit of meaning that may span multiple modalities, such
as text, data, code, audio, or formal proof. Unlike a post or message, a semantic object persists across
time and accumulates structure through controlled transformation.
Definition 2 (Well-Formed Semantic Object). A semantic object σ is well-formed if and only if for all
m ∈M, the content assignment C(m) is defined.
5

Well-formedness enforces modality completeness. For example, a claim that requires both textual
explanation and empirical evidence cannot be considered complete until both modalities are populated.
2.2
Examples and Counterexamples
As a motivating example, consider a scientific hypothesis represented as a semantic object with modal-
ities {text, data, analysis}. A draft hypothesis with only textual content is not well-formed. It becomes
well-formed only once supporting data and analysis are attached.
In contrast, a short social media post asserting the hypothesis without evidence would constitute
a semantic object with M = {text}, thereby encoding a different and weaker claim. This distinction
prevents implicit inflation of meaning and clarifies the scope of assertions.
2.3
Semantic Entropy
We now formalize the notion of semantic entropy.
Definition 3 (Semantic Entropy). Let σ be a semantic object. The semantic entropy E(σ) is a scalar
quantity that measures internal inconsistency, ambiguity, or unresolved divergence within the object.
Semantic entropy is not identical to Shannon entropy, though it may incorporate information-
theoretic components. Operationally, it bounds the degree to which a semantic object can tolerate
conflicting content, incomplete modalities, or unresolved branches.
Definition 4 (Entropy-Bounded Transformation). A transformation T applied to a semantic object σ is
entropy-bounded if
E(T(σ)) ≤E(σ) + ε
for a fixed budget ε ≥0 associated with T.
Entropy budgets constrain how much disorder a transformation may introduce. Transformations
that exceed their budgets are rejected or deferred pending reconciliation.
2.4
Semantic Transformations
Transformations operate on semantic objects to produce new versions.
Definition 5 (Semantic Transformation). A semantic transformation is a partial function
T : Σ →Σ
defined on the space of semantic objects Σ, subject to modality preservation and entropy constraints.
Examples of transformations include revision, extension, summarization, translation, and formal-
ization. Each transformation specifies its input and output modality requirements and an associated
entropy budget.
6

Proposition 1 (Monotonic Provenance). Every valid transformation T(σ) extends the provenance graph
P of σ by adding a new node corresponding to T.
Proof. By construction, transformations are required to record their application as edges in the prove-
nance graph. Since identities are immutable and transformations are append-only, the graph grows
monotonically.
2.5
Provenance Graph Structure
Provenance is represented as a directed acyclic graph.
Definition 6 (Provenance Graph). The provenance graph P of a semantic object σ is a directed acyclic
graph whose nodes correspond to transformation events and whose edges encode dependency relations be-
tween transformations.
The acyclicity of P ensures that semantic evolution is temporally ordered and that every state has
a finite justification history.
Theorem 1 (Traceability). For any semantic object σ, every content element C(m) admits a finite deriva-
tion trace in P.
Sketch. Since P is acyclic and transformations are finite in number for any realized object, each content
element corresponds to a path from an initial state to the current state.
2.6
Coherence Enforcement
Coherence is enforced mechanically through validation checks.
Definition 7 (Coherent State). A semantic object σ is coherent if it is well-formed and its semantic entropy
does not exceed a system-defined threshold Emax.
Proposition 2 (Rejection of Unbounded Drift). Unbounded semantic drift is structurally impossible in a
system enforcing entropy-bounded transformations.
Sketch. Suppose an unbounded drift occurs. Then E(σ) must increase without bound along a sequence
of transformations. This contradicts the existence of fixed entropy budgets and the enforcement of
Emax.
2.7
Identity and Persistence
Identity is defined at the level of semantic objects.
Definition 8 (Persistent Identity). The identity I of a semantic object is immutable and preserved across
all valid transformations.
Deletion is therefore interpreted not as erasure but as a transformation that marks an object as
inactive while preserving its provenance.
7

Lemma 1 (Non-Repudiation). No valid transformation can remove or alter prior provenance.
Proof. Transformations are append-only with respect to provenance. Any operation that attempts to
remove prior nodes violates the definition of a semantic transformation.
This completes the formal foundation of coherence-first semantic evolution.

Concrete Instantiation and Worked Examples
To clarify how a coherence-first semantic substrate operates in practice, this section presents a series
of worked examples. These examples illustrate the lifecycle of semantic objects, the application of
entropy-bounded transformations, identity persistence under revision and deletion, and navigation
through semantic neighborhoods in contrast to feed-based browsing.
3.1
Lifecycle of a Semantic Object
Consider an initial semantic object σ0 representing a factual claim. Let the required modality set be
M = {text, evidence}.
At time t0, only the textual modality is populated. The object is therefore not well-formed.
A transformation T1 attaches empirical evidence, yielding σ1 such that Cσ1(evidence) is defined.
Provided that T1 satisfies its entropy budget, σ1 becomes well-formed and eligible for further transfor-
mation. The provenance graph records T1 as a child of σ0.
A subsequent transformation T2 revises the textual explanation for clarity. Because T2 preserves
modality completeness and introduces only bounded entropy, the resulting object σ2 remains coherent.
Importantly, σ0, σ1, and σ2 share a common identity and are linked by provenance rather than replacing
one another.
3.2
Entropy-Bounded Revision
Revision is a common operation in discourse and often a source of semantic instability in feed-based
systems. In the coherence-first model, revision is formalized as a transformation with a tightly con-
strained entropy budget.
Let Tr be a revision transformation with budget εr. Applying Tr to σ yields σ′ only if
E(σ′) ≤E(σ) + εr.
If a proposed revision introduces ambiguity, contradiction, or modality imbalance beyond this thresh-
old, it is rejected or flagged for mediation.
This mechanism distinguishes legitimate refinement from destabilizing alteration. Incremental clar-
ification typically falls within budget, while radical reinterpretation requires explicit branching, preserv-
ing traceability.
8

3.3
Branching and Conflict Resolution
Conflicts arise when incompatible transformations are proposed. In such cases, the provenance graph
branches.
Let σ admit two transformations Ta and Tb that cannot be reconciled within a shared entropy budget.
The system produces two descendant objects σa and σb, each inheriting the identity of σ but diverging
in provenance.
Rather than forcing premature resolution, the system allows both branches to persist. Subsequent
transformations may reconcile the branches by introducing additional evidence, clarification, or scope
restriction. Any reconciliation must itself be entropy-bounded and is recorded as a transformation
whose provenance references both branches.
This approach contrasts with feed-based systems, where conflicts are resolved implicitly through
visibility dynamics rather than explicit semantic structure.
3.4
Deletion and Retraction
Deletion presents a critical edge case. In social media, deletion often erases context, undermining
accountability and enabling revisionist narratives.
In a coherence-first system, deletion is modeled as a transformation Td that marks a semantic object
as inactive. The content remains accessible for provenance and reference, but the object is no longer
eligible for extension or endorsement.
Retraction is handled similarly but includes an explicit statement of invalidation. A retraction trans-
formation increases semantic entropy temporarily while introducing constraints that prevent further
use of the object as a premise. This preserves historical traceability while signaling reduced validity.
3.5
Identity Persistence Across Time
Identity persistence follows directly from the immutability of semantic object identities. All transforma-
tions preserve identity, ensuring that long-term evolution remains traceable even as content changes.
This property supports longitudinal trust. Observers can inspect how an object has changed, which
transformations were applied, and which branches were reconciled or abandoned. Trust is therefore
grounded in demonstrated behavior over time rather than static declarations or popularity signals.
3.6
Semantic Neighborhood Navigation
Discovery in a coherence-first system operates through semantic neighborhoods rather than feeds.
Users encounter semantic objects by traversing relationships defined by shared modalities, transforma-
tion types, or provenance connections.
Navigation proceeds through deliberate exploration rather than passive consumption. Because ob-
jects persist and accumulate structure, older but coherent material remains discoverable without being
displaced by newer content.
This mode of interaction privileges understanding over immediacy and reduces the attention frag-
mentation characteristic of infinite scroll interfaces.

3.7
Comparison with Feed Browsing
In feed-based systems, relevance decays rapidly with time, and visibility is governed by engagement
metrics. In contrast, semantic neighborhoods decouple relevance from recency. Objects remain acces-
sible as long as they remain coherent.
This shift alters user incentives. Contributions that improve coherence, clarify meaning, or recon-
cile conflict are rewarded structurally, while reactive or sensational content gains no inherent advan-
tage.
These examples demonstrate that the coherence-first model is not merely theoretical but opera-
tionally viable, offering concrete mechanisms for discourse, revision, and discovery without reliance
on feeds or engagement metrics.

Challenges, Limitations, and Structural Tradeoffs
The coherence-first semantic substrate described in this paper is not merely an alternative content
organization scheme, but a reconfiguration of social interaction around spatial, computational, and
educational primitives. In this section, we revisit challenges and limitations under the assumption that
the platform functions simultaneously as a programming environment, a persistent semantic memory,
and a navigable social space embedded in a high-dimensional latent geometry.
4.1
Scalability in a Spatial Semantic Medium
Concerns regarding scalability are often framed in terms of throughput and user count, implicitly as-
suming feed-based dissemination as the baseline. In a spatial semantic system, scale is expressed dif-
ferently. Growth manifests as expansion of a latent semantic manifold rather than increased velocity
within a global feed.
Knowledge objects are not broadcast to all users. Instead, they occupy stable locations in semantic
space. As the system grows, density increases locally rather than globally, and users encounter content
by navigating regions of interest. This mirrors physical environments, where cities scale by adding
neighborhoods rather than forcing all activity through a single thoroughfare.
This spatialization fundamentally alters adversarial scaling dynamics. Engagement-driven plat-
forms monetize attention by selling advertising inventory, frequently to actors whose business models
depend on deception, including known scam networks. These platforms therefore benefit financially
from maximizing exposure, regardless of semantic quality. In contrast, a spatial semantic medium offers
no global amplification mechanism to exploit. Content remains localized unless structurally integrated
into broader semantic regions.
4.2
Onboarding Through Programming as Literacy
A frequent critique of structured systems is their perceived difficulty for newcomers. However, the
platform under consideration explicitly incorporates programming education as a first-class function
10

through the SpherePOP calculus. Users are not expected to master formal systems upfront; rather, they
learn by interacting with semantic objects whose behavior is governed by simple, composable rules.
Programming in this context is not an auxiliary skill but a literacy: the ability to construct, trans-
form, and navigate meaning. By embedding programming instruction directly into social interaction,
the system converts what is traditionally a barrier into a continuous learning process.
This contrasts sharply with existing platforms, where users are incentivized to spend substantial
time curating follow lists, monitoring engagement metrics, and pursuing arbitrary follower goals. Such
activity consumes attention without producing durable knowledge or skill. In the coherence-first sys-
tem, time invested in learning the substrate directly increases one's expressive and navigational capac-
ity.
4.3
Persistence, Memory, and Reaccessibility
Semantic persistence introduces a distinct limitation: content cannot be trivially forgotten. However,
this persistence enables a powerful alternative to feed consumption. Knowledge is stored in stable
locations within the semantic latent space and can be reaccessed by returning to the same region.
This property transforms memory from a chronological archive into a spatial one. Users do not
scroll backward through time but revisit conceptual neighborhoods. Over time, these neighborhoods
accrete structure, becoming richer rather than buried.
While this challenges habitual consumption patterns shaped by infinite scroll interfaces, it aligns
more closely with how expertise and understanding develop. The cost is reduced novelty throughput;
the benefit is cumulative intelligibility.
4.4
Adversarial Behavior in a Navigable Space
Adversarial behavior in a spatial semantic system differs qualitatively from that in broadcast platforms.
Without feeds or engagement metrics, attackers cannot leverage visibility cascades. Instead, malicious
content must occupy space, persist, and withstand entropy constraints.
Attempts to game entropy budgets or flood regions with low-quality objects are constrained by
both computational and navigational friction. Users encounter such content only by entering the rele-
vant regions, and repeated incoherent transformations accumulate entropy that eventually blocks fur-
ther evolution.
Crucially, the absence of an advertising-driven revenue model removes the primary financial in-
centive for large-scale spam. Traditional platforms profit from keeping users engaged, even if that
engagement consists of navigating scams, outrage, or empty status games. A spatial semantic plat-
form derives no benefit from time-wasting behavior oriented around following, metric optimization,
or performative presence.
4.5
Expression, Revision, and Spatial Accountability
Freedom of expression in a spatial semantic medium is preserved through transformation rather than
erasure. Users may revise, retract, or contextualize prior contributions, but these actions are recorded
11

as movements or transformations within semantic space.
This introduces a form of spatial accountability. Past statements remain accessible at their origi-
nal locations, while newer interpretations may occupy adjacent or higher-order regions. Growth is
represented geometrically rather than narratively.
While this model may feel restrictive to users accustomed to disappearing content, it reflects norms
already present in scholarly and technical domains, where retracted or superseded work remains part
of the record.
4.6
Migration and Hybrid Use
Migration from existing platforms remains nontrivial, but the spatial model enables hybrid strategies.
External content can be imported as semantic objects anchored to regions of space that reflect their
topical and structural properties. Over time, these imports may be extended, formalized, or abandoned.
Notably, the system does not attempt to import engagement artifacts such as likes, shares, or fol-
lower counts. These signals have no spatial or semantic meaning and are therefore discarded. Users
migrating into the system are freed from the obligation to maintain continuous visibility or pursue
follower accumulation as a proxy for participation.
4.7
Summary of Tradeoffs
The coherence-first, spatial semantic platform prioritizes cumulative understanding, programming lit-
eracy, and persistent memory over immediacy and attention capture. It is therefore incompatible with
advertising-driven social media models and the behavioral patterns they encourage.
Its limitations are real: increased cognitive demand, slower initial growth, and a requirement that
users engage actively with structure. Its advantages are equally real: durable knowledge, teachable
computation, and a social medium in which time spent produces skill and understanding rather than
exhaustion.
5
Formalization and Quantitative Analysis
This section formalizes the central claims of the coherence-first spatial semantic architecture and an-
alyzes its properties using tools from information theory, dynamical systems, and computational com-
plexity. We compare feed-based dissemination with semantic neighborhood navigation, model trust
accumulation under persistence, and establish convergence guarantees under entropy-bounded evolu-
tion.
5.1
Preliminaries
Let Σ denote the space of all semantic objects, and let X denote the semantic latent manifold in which
objects are embedded. Each semantic object σ ∈Σ is associated with an embedding ϕ(σ) ∈X, a
provenance graph P(σ), and a semantic entropy value E(σ).
12

Users interact with the system by navigating X, applying transformations to semantic objects, and
composing programs in a structured transformation language.
5.2
Feed-Based Dissemination versus Semantic Neighborhoods
We first contrast feed-based dissemination with spatial semantic navigation.
Definition 9 (Feed Model). A feed-based system presents users with a sequence
Fu(t) = ⟨c1, c2, . . . , cn⟩
ordered by a relevance function R(c, u, t) optimized for engagement metrics such as clicks, likes, or dwell
time.
Definition 10 (Semantic Neighborhood Model). A semantic neighborhood system presents users with
content
Nu(x, r) = {σ ∈Σ | d(ϕ(σ), x) ≤r}
where x ∈X is the user's current location in semantic space and r is a bounded radius.
Proposition 3 (Entropy Accumulation in Feeds). Feed-based dissemination induces unbounded semantic
entropy accumulation over time.
Sketch. In feed systems, content relevance decays with time and is replaced by new content optimized
for engagement rather than coherence. There is no constraint enforcing semantic consistency across
items in Fu(t). As t →∞, the expected semantic divergence between consecutive items grows without
bound, yielding unbounded entropy.
Proposition 4 (Entropy Localization in Semantic Neighborhoods). In a semantic neighborhood system,
entropy accumulation is locally bounded.
Sketch. Semantic neighborhoods restrict interaction to bounded regions of X. Transformations applied
within a neighborhood must satisfy entropy budgets. Therefore, entropy growth is constrained locally
and does not propagate globally.
5.3
Information-Theoretic Comparison
Let H(Fu) denote the entropy of a user's feed and H(Nu) the entropy of a semantic neighborhood.
Theorem 2 (Asymptotic Entropy Divergence). For feed-based systems,
lim
t→∞H(Fu(t)) = ∞,
whereas for semantic neighborhoods,
sup
t
H(Nu(x, t)) ≤Hmax
for some finite bound Hmax.
13

Sketch. Feed entropy increases as content turnover introduces uncorrelated items optimized for engage-
ment. Semantic neighborhoods impose correlation through spatial proximity and entropy-bounded
transformations, yielding a finite upper bound.
This result formalizes the intuition that feeds maximize novelty while neighborhoods preserve
structure.
5.4
Trust Accumulation: Persistence versus Popularity
We now model trust accumulation.
Definition 11 (Popularity-Based Trust). In engagement systems, trust is approximated by a function
Tpop(u, t) = f(Lu(t), Su(t), Fu(t))
where L denotes likes, S shares, and F follower count.
Definition 12 (Persistence-Based Trust). In a coherence-first system, trust is defined as
Tpers(u, t) = g(|Pu(t)|, ∆Eu(t), Cu(t))
where |Pu| is the size of the user's provenance graph, ∆Eu measures entropy stability over time, and Cu
denotes successful reconciliations.
Proposition 5 (Instability of Popularity Trust). Popularity-based trust is unstable under adversarial op-
timization.
Sketch. Engagement metrics can be manipulated through coordinated activity, bot networks, or sen-
sational content. Small perturbations in visibility can cause large changes in Tpop, rendering it unreli-
able.
Theorem 3 (Monotonicity of Persistence Trust). Persistence-based trust is monotonic under valid trans-
formations.
Proof. Valid transformations append to provenance and are entropy-bounded. Therefore, |Pu| and
reconciliation counts increase monotonically, while entropy stability penalizes destabilizing behavior.
5.5
Convergence and Stability under Entropy Bounds
We model semantic evolution as a dynamical system.
Definition 13 (Semantic Evolution Operator). Let T denote the set of admissible transformations. Define
Et+1 = T (Et)
subject to entropy constraints.
14

Theorem 4 (Convergence of Semantic Objects). Under fixed entropy budgets, semantic object evolution
converges to stable attractors in Σ.
Sketch. Entropy budgets impose a Lyapunov-like constraint on semantic evolution. Since entropy
cannot increase without bound and transformations are finite, sequences converge to fixed points or
bounded cycles representing stable interpretations.
This establishes long-term stability absent from feed-based systems.
5.6
Programming Literacy and Learning Efficiency
Let Lu(t) denote a user's programming literacy as measured by successful semantic transformations
composed in the transformation language.
Proposition 6 (Positive Learning Gradient). In a system where social interaction is mediated through
programmable transformations, expected programming literacy increases monotonically with use.
Sketch. Each interaction requires the application or observation of typed transformations. Unlike feed
consumption, which yields no cumulative skill, repeated interaction increases the user's effective action
space.
This contrasts with engagement systems, where time spent pursuing follower goals yields no durable
competence.
5.7
Computational Complexity
We conclude with complexity analysis.
Let n be the number of semantic objects, k the maximum degree of provenance graphs, and m the
number of transformations.
Proposition 7 (Transformation Complexity). Applying a transformation has time complexity O(k) and
space complexity O(1).
Proposition 8 (Neighborhood Query Complexity). Semantic neighborhood queries execute in O(log n +
|Nu|) using standard spatial indexing.
Theorem 5 (Global Scalability). Total system complexity grows sublinearly with user count under bounded
neighborhood interaction.
Sketch. Users interact locally in semantic space. No global feed requires recomputation or ranking
across all objects. Therefore, system load scales with local density rather than total population.
This completes the formal and quantitative analysis of the coherence-first semantic architecture.

Artificial Intelligence as a Typed Semantic Operator
In the coherence-first semantic architecture, artificial intelligence is neither a primary agent nor a
curator of attention. Instead, AI functions as a constrained operator within the semantic substrate,
performing well-defined transformations under explicit structural and entropy constraints. This sec-
tion formalizes the role of AI and contrasts it with the recommender-centric models that dominate
contemporary social media.
6.1
Rejection of AI as a Relevance Oracle
Most social media platforms deploy AI primarily as a relevance oracle: a system that predicts which
content will maximize user engagement. This framing aligns AI incentives with time spent, emotional
arousal, and interaction volume. As a result, recommender systems become amplifiers of whatever
content best exploits human cognitive biases, regardless of semantic quality.
The coherence-first architecture explicitly rejects this role. AI systems are not tasked with ranking
users, optimizing feeds, or predicting attention. There is no global feed to optimize, and no engagement
metric to maximize. Consequently, entire classes of alignment failures associated with recommender
systems are rendered inapplicable.
6.2
Typed Semantic Operations
AI operates exclusively through typed semantic transformations.
Definition 14 (Typed Semantic Operator). A typed semantic operator is a transformation
T : (Σ, Min) →(Σ, Mout)
that maps semantic objects with input modality requirements Min to objects with output modality require-
ments Mout, subject to fixed entropy budgets.
Examples include summarization, translation, modality completion, formalization, compression,
and reconciliation assistance. Each operator declares the modalities it consumes and produces, enabling
static validation prior to execution.
6.3
Entropy Budgets and Validation
Every AI operator is associated with an entropy budget εT . After application, the resulting semantic
object is evaluated for coherence.
Proposition 9 (Post-Transformation Validation). An AI-generated transformation is accepted if and only
if the resulting semantic object is well-formed and satisfies the entropy bound
E(T(σ)) ≤E(σ) + εT .
If validation fails, the transformation is rejected or returned for human mediation. AI therefore
cannot unilaterally inject ambiguity, contradiction, or scope inflation into the system.
16

6.4
Failure Modes and Recovery
AI transformations may fail due to insufficient input structure, modality mismatch, or exceeding en-
tropy budgets. Rather than silently degrading output quality, such failures are explicitly surfaced.
Failed transformations generate diagnostic artifacts indicating missing modalities, uncertain map-
pings, or unresolved inconsistencies. These artifacts become semantic objects in their own right, en-
abling users to inspect and address the failure.
This contrasts with engagement systems, where AI failures are often invisible and manifest only
indirectly through degraded discourse quality.
6.5
Training Data and Bias Mitigation
Because AI operators perform constrained transformations rather than open-ended generation, train-
ing data requirements differ substantially from those of large language models deployed as conversa-
tional agents. Training focuses on mapping between modalities and preserving semantic invariants
rather than imitating human conversational behavior.
Bias mitigation is addressed structurally. Since AI output must satisfy explicit semantic constraints
and provenance requirements, biased or misleading transformations are more readily detectable. More-
over, the absence of engagement optimization removes incentives to exploit polarizing or sensational
patterns present in training data.
6.6
Human-AI Collaboration
AI in a coherence-first system functions as a collaborator rather than a substitute for human judg-
ment. It assists users in navigating semantic space, identifying inconsistencies, and performing routine
transformations, but it does not author meaning independently.
This role aligns AI incentives with clarity and stability rather than persuasion or attention capture.
By constraining AI to typed operations with explicit budgets, the system ensures that human agency
and accountability remain central.
6.7
Summary
By redefining AI as a typed semantic operator rather than a relevance oracle, the coherence-first archi-
tecture avoids the alignment failures endemic to engagement-driven systems. AI becomes a tool for
maintaining semantic integrity and supporting learning, including programming literacy, rather than
a mechanism for amplifying noise or optimizing visibility.

Governance, Invariants, and Forking Mechanics
Governance in feed-based social media platforms is typically implemented as an external layer: policies,
moderators, enforcement actions, and appeals. These mechanisms operate reactively, intervening after
semantic damage has occurred and often at scales that render consistent enforcement impractical. In
contrast, the coherence-first semantic architecture embeds governance into the formal structure of
17

the system itself. This section specifies the invariants that define admissible behavior, the procedural
handling of conflict and divergence, and the mechanics of forking as a first-class operation.
7.1
Governance by Structural Invariants
At the core of the system is a set of invariants that all valid semantic states must satisfy. These invariants
are enforced mechanically rather than socially.
Definition 15 (Semantic Invariant). A semantic invariant is a property I(σ) of a semantic object σ that
must hold for σ to be considered valid within the system.
Examples include modality completeness, provenance monotonicity, and bounded semantic en-
tropy. Violations of invariants do not trigger punitive action; instead, they prevent the object from
participating in further transformations until resolved.
Proposition 10 (Invariant-Based Governance). All admissible system states satisfy the set of semantic
invariants.
Proof. Invariant checks are applied at the time of transformation. Since invalid states are rejected by
construction, no reachable system state violates the invariants.
This approach shifts governance from discretionary enforcement to constraint satisfaction.
7.2
Semantic Reconciliation
Disagreement is an expected feature of discourse. The coherence-first system does not attempt to
eliminate disagreement but to represent it explicitly.
Definition 16 (Semantic Reconciliation). Semantic reconciliation is a transformation that integrates di-
vergent branches of a semantic object by introducing additional structure that resolves or contextualizes
their differences.
Reconciliation may involve narrowing scope, introducing conditionality, or adding supporting modal-
ities. Crucially, reconciliation is optional rather than mandatory; the system permits persistent diver-
gence when resolution is not possible or desirable.
Proposition 11 (Non-Coercive Resolution). No semantic object is required to reconcile divergent branches.
Proof. Branching is a valid terminal state. The absence of a reconciliation transformation does not
violate any invariant.
This ensures that governance does not collapse into enforced consensus.
18

7.3
Forking as a First-Class Operation
Forking is treated as a constructive operation rather than a failure mode.
Definition 17 (Semantic Fork). A semantic fork is the creation of two or more descendant semantic objects
that diverge from a common ancestor due to incompatible transformations.
Forks preserve shared provenance up to the point of divergence and then evolve independently.
Unlike moderation-based deletion or suppression, forking externalizes conflict rather than obscuring
it.
7.4
Tracking Divergence
Divergence is tracked explicitly in the provenance graph. Users navigating semantic space can observe
where and why forks occurred, inspect the transformations that produced them, and choose which
branches to engage with.
This transparency contrasts with feed-based systems, where divergence is often masked by algo-
rithmic filtering or visibility dynamics.
7.5
Coordinated Attacks and Structural Resistance
Coordinated attacks, such as brigading or disinformation campaigns, exploit amplification mechanisms
in engagement-driven systems. The coherence-first architecture removes these mechanisms entirely.
Without feeds, likes, or shares, attackers cannot leverage visibility cascades. Malicious content
must persist, occupy semantic space, and withstand invariant checks. Coordinated low-quality trans-
formations accumulate entropy and exhaust available budgets, limiting their impact.
7.6
Emergent Norms
While formal invariants define the boundaries of admissible behavior, norms emerge through use. Be-
cause semantic objects persist and interactions are traceable, norms stabilize over time rather than
being enforced episodically.
This separation of formal constraints from emergent norms allows the system to accommodate di-
verse communities without imposing uniform standards beyond those required for semantic coherence.
7.7
Summary
Governance in a coherence-first semantic substrate is achieved through invariants, transparent recon-
ciliation, and explicit forking rather than moderation and suppression. By embedding governance into
the structure of meaning itself, the system avoids many of the failure modes associated with discre-
tionary enforcement and algorithmic opacity.

Implementation Considerations
While the coherence-first semantic architecture is motivated by theoretical and information-theoretic
considerations, its viability depends on concrete implementation choices. This section outlines practical
considerations related to storage, identity, networking, and performance. The goal is not to prescribe
a single implementation, but to demonstrate that the proposed architecture is computationally feasible
with existing technology.
8.1
Storage of Semantic Objects and Provenance
Semantic objects are persistent, immutable entities whose evolution is recorded through append-only
provenance graphs. This naturally suggests a storage model based on content-addressed data struc-
tures. Each semantic object state can be identified by a cryptographic hash of its content, modality
assignments, and provenance references.
Provenance graphs grow monotonically but typically exhibit low branching factors in practice.
Since transformations are localized and entropy-bounded, most objects evolve through short, inter-
pretable chains rather than deep or highly branching structures. This enables efficient storage through
structural sharing, similar to persistent data structures used in functional programming languages.
Garbage collection is unnecessary in the traditional sense, as objects are never mutated or deleted.
Instead, inactive or superseded objects can be indexed separately or cached at lower priority without
violating persistence guarantees.
8.2
Indexing and Semantic Space Navigation
Efficient navigation of semantic neighborhoods requires spatial indexing over the latent manifold X.
Standard techniques such as approximate nearest-neighbor search, metric trees, or locality-sensitive
hashing can be employed to support neighborhood queries.
Because users interact locally within semantic space, query complexity depends primarily on lo-
cal density rather than global object count. This property enables horizontal scaling by partitioning
semantic space across nodes while preserving navigability.
Importantly, indexing operates over semantic embeddings rather than engagement metrics. This
eliminates the need for continuous global re-ranking and reduces system-wide recomputation.
8.3
Identity Anchoring and Authentication
Identity in the coherence-first system is defined by persistent identifiers rather than profiles or ac-
counts. Cryptographic primitives can be used to anchor identity securely. Each identity may be asso-
ciated with a public key, and transformations can be signed to establish authorship without revealing
unnecessary personal information.
This model supports pseudonymity while preserving accountability. Because identity is anchored
structurally rather than socially, reputation laundering through account recreation or metric manipu-
lation is ineffective.
20

8.4
Distributed Deployment and Federation
The architecture is compatible with distributed and federated deployment. Semantic space can be par-
titioned across nodes or instances, with each node responsible for maintaining a region of the latent
manifold and the objects embedded within it.
Federation does not require global agreement on ranking or moderation policies. Nodes need only
agree on core invariants governing semantic object validity and transformation. This reduces coordi-
nation overhead and allows heterogeneous communities to coexist without fragmenting the substrate.
Cross-node interaction is mediated through provenance references and embedding mappings, en-
suring that semantic integrity is preserved even when objects traverse administrative boundaries.
8.5
Performance Characteristics
Performance in engagement-driven platforms is dominated by feed ranking and recommendation pipelines,
which require continuous large-scale computation. In contrast, the coherence-first architecture shifts
computation toward transformation validation and spatial queries.
Transformation validation is localized and bounded in complexity, as entropy budgets and modality
checks constrain the scope of evaluation. Spatial queries benefit from standard indexing techniques and
do not require system-wide recomputation.
As a result, system load scales with active semantic regions rather than total user count or content
volume. This property supports long-term growth without the runaway computational costs associ-
ated with global feeds.
8.6
Programming Interface and SpherePOP Integration
The integration of a programmable transformation language, such as SpherePOP, introduces additional
implementation considerations. Programs operate over semantic objects and must respect modality and
entropy constraints. Static analysis can be employed to verify that programs are well-typed and cannot
violate invariants.
Because programming constructs are embedded directly into social interaction, tooling for debug-
ging, visualization, and explanation is essential. However, the simplicity of the underlying calculus
enables incremental learning and compositional reuse.
By treating programming as a medium of interaction rather than a specialized activity, the system
aligns implementation complexity with user skill development rather than hiding it behind opaque
automation.
8.7
Summary
The coherence-first semantic architecture can be implemented using existing storage, indexing, cryp-
tographic, and distributed systems techniques. Its performance profile differs substantially from that
of engagement-driven platforms, emphasizing locality, persistence, and validation over global opti-
mization. These properties make it suitable for scalable deployment without reproducing the incentive
structures that undermine contemporary social media.
21

Conclusion and Research Agenda
This paper has argued that the dominant failures of contemporary social media platforms are not in-
cidental defects, but necessary consequences of their underlying architecture. Feed-based dissemina-
tion, engagement optimization, and performative identity together produce high-entropy dynamics
that degrade meaning, incentivize time-wasting behavior, and erode trust at scale. Attempts to repair
these systems through moderation, transparency, or algorithmic adjustment leave the core substrate
unchanged and therefore fail to address the root causes.
In response, we have outlined a coherence-first alternative grounded in persistent semantic objects,
entropy-bounded evolution, provenance-anchored identity, and spatial navigation of meaning. Rather
than treating communication as a stream of posts optimized for visibility, the proposed architecture
treats meaning as a structured entity that evolves through constrained transformations. Trust emerges
from persistence and consistency over time rather than popularity or attention metrics.
We formalized the key components of this architecture, including semantic objects, transformation
operators, entropy budgets, and provenance graphs. We demonstrated that feed-based systems exhibit
unbounded entropy accumulation, while semantic neighborhoods localize and constrain disorder. We
showed that trust models based on persistence are structurally more stable than those based on pop-
ularity, and that entropy-bounded evolution yields convergence properties absent from engagement-
driven platforms. We further analyzed computational complexity and demonstrated that the system
scales through locality rather than global optimization.
Importantly, the architecture reframes the role of artificial intelligence. By constraining AI to typed
semantic operations under explicit budgets, the system avoids the alignment failures associated with
recommender systems and attention optimization. AI becomes a tool for maintaining coherence, assist-
ing learning, and supporting programming literacy rather than amplifying noise or persuasion.
The integration of a programmable semantic calculus transforms social interaction into a learning
process. Time spent within the system produces durable skills and knowledge rather than ephemeral
engagement. Knowledge persists spatially and can be reaccessed by returning to the same region of
semantic space, enabling cumulative understanding rather than chronological decay.
9.1
Open Problems and Future Work
Several open problems remain. First, while entropy-bounded evolution provides strong stability guar-
antees, further work is needed to refine entropy metrics that balance flexibility with constraint across
diverse domains. Second, the design of user interfaces for high-dimensional semantic navigation re-
mains an active area of research, particularly with respect to accessibility and cognitive load. Third,
empirical studies are required to evaluate learning outcomes, trust formation, and discourse quality in
deployed systems.
Additional work is needed to explore incentive models compatible with coherence-first design.
Advertising-driven revenue is fundamentally misaligned with persistence and semantic integrity. Al-
ternative models, such as patronage, institutional support, or public infrastructure funding, warrant
systematic investigation.
22

Finally, the relationship between coherence-first platforms and existing digital ecosystems remains
to be fully articulated. Hybrid deployments, migration strategies, and interoperability with legacy
systems present both technical and social challenges.
9.2
Broader Implications
Beyond social media, the coherence-first architecture has implications for knowledge management,
education, scientific collaboration, and governance. Any domain in which meaning must persist, evolve,
and remain accountable over time stands to benefit from a substrate that prioritizes structure over
visibility.
By rethinking the primitives of digital interaction, this work contributes to a growing body of re-
search that treats platform design as a problem of semantics and systems architecture rather than con-
tent moderation alone. It suggests that healthier digital public spheres require not better incentives
layered atop existing systems, but new substrates in which certain failure modes are structurally im-
possible.
9.3
Closing Remarks
The central claim of this paper is that coherence is not an emergent property of engagement-optimized
systems, but a design choice that must be encoded at the substrate level. A coherence-first semantic
architecture offers a viable alternative to social media as currently constituted, one in which time spent
produces understanding rather than exhaustion, and where trust is earned through persistence rather
than performance.
We invite further research, experimentation, and critique of this approach as part of a broader effort
to reimagine the foundations of digital communication.

Preliminaries
Let Σ denote the space of well-formed semantic objects defined in Appendix A. For σ ∈Σ, recall:
σ = (i, Mσ, Cσ, Pσ, Eσ).
Let Ωbe a measurable space of semantic interpretations, and let
µσ : Ω→[0, 1]
be a probability measure induced by the content and provenance of σ.
B.2
Semantic Entropy Definition
Definition 25 (Semantic Entropy Functional). Define semantic entropy as:

∫
Ω
µσ(ω) log µσ(ω) dω
where H denotes Shannon entropy.
Definition 26 (Conditional Semantic Entropy). Given provenance Pσ, define:
E(σ | Pσ) := H(µσ | Pσ).
This quantity measures ambiguity remaining after accounting for derivational context.
B.3
Entropy Decomposition
Lemma 2 (Entropy Decomposition). For any σ ∈Σ,
E(σ) = E(Cσ) + E(Pσ) −I(Cσ; Pσ)
where I is mutual information.
Proof. Direct from Shannon entropy identities.
B.4
Entropy-Bounded Transformations
Definition 27 (Transformation Operator). A semantic transformation is a function:
T : Σ →Σ
such that identity and provenance monotonicity are preserved.

formations (Tk) such that:
E(σn) < E(σ0)
while increasing semantic ambiguity.
Theorem 10 (No Entropy Laundering). Entropy laundering is impossible under entropy-bounded trans-
formations.
Proof. Entropy reduction requires negative εT , which is disallowed. Any reduction in E(σ) must arise
from added structure or information, not reordering or deletion.

B.8
Branching and Entropy
Lemma 4 (Branch Entropy Conservation). Let σ →{σ1, σ2} be a fork. Then:
E(σ1) + E(σ2) ≥E(σ).

Operational Semantics
Define a small-step operational semantics:
⟨p, σ⟩→σ′
⟨id, σ⟩→σ
⟨T, σ⟩→T(σ)
if E(T(σ)) ≤E(σ) + εT
⟨p1; p2, σ⟩→⟨p2, σ′⟩
if ⟨p1, σ⟩→σ′
⟨p1 ⊕p2, σ⟩→σ′
if either branch yields valid output
F.6
Entropy Preservation
Lemma 8 (Stepwise Entropy Bound). If
⟨p, σ⟩→σ′
and
Γ ⊢p : Σ →Σ,
then
E(σ′) ≤E(σ) + ε.
F.7
Type Preservation
Theorem 23 (Subject Reduction). If
Γ ⊢p : Σ →Σ
and
⟨p, σ⟩→σ′,
then σ′ ∈Σ.
Proof. By induction on the structure of p using primitive and composition rules.
F.8
Progress
Theorem 24 (Progress). If Γ ⊢p : Σ →Σ and σ ∈Σ, then either
p = id
or
∃σ′. ⟨p, σ⟩→σ′.

F.9
Confluence Properties
Definition 65 (Confluent Program). A program p is confluent iff all valid evaluation paths produce exten-
sionally equal semantic objects.
Theorem 25 (Local Confluence Under Entropy Bounds). If all primitive transformations in p commute
and respect entropy bounds, then p is confluent.
F.10
Consequences
[No Hidden Side Effects] Spherepop programs cannot modify semantic state outside explicit transfor-
mations.
[Programmable Social Interaction] All social interaction reduces to well-typed program execution
over Σ.
G
Deterministic Substrate (Spherepop OS)
G.1
Event Log
Let E be a countable set of events.
Definition 66 (Event). An event is a tuple
e = (t, u, p, σin, σout)
where:
t ∈R≥0
(timestamp)
u ∈U
(identity)
p ∈P
(Spherepop program)
σin, σout ∈Σ.
Definition 67 (Event Log). An event log is a sequence
L = ⟨e1, e2, . . . ⟩
totally ordered by timestamp.
G.2
Kernel State
Definition 68 (Kernel State). A kernel state is a tuple
K = (O, U, R, M)
37

where:
O ⊂Σ
(active semantic objects)
U ⊂U
(identities)
R ⊂O × O
(references)
M ⊂M
(active modalities).
G.3
State Transition Function
Definition 69 (Transition Function). Define the deterministic transition function
δ : K × E →K
such that:
δ(K, e) = K′
where K′ is obtained by validating and applying p(e) to σin.
Definition 70 (Validity Condition). An event e is valid iff:
Γ ⊢p(e) : Σ →Σ
and
σout = p(e)(σin).
G.4
Replay Semantics
Definition 71 (Replay Operator). Define replay as:
Replay(L≤n) = δ(. . . δ(δ(K0, e1), e2), . . . , en)
for fixed initial state K0.
Theorem 26 (Replay Determinism). For any prefix L≤n, the resulting kernel state is unique.
Proof. δ is deterministic and events are totally ordered.
G.5
Late-Joiner Equivalence
Definition 72 (Late Joiner). A late joiner is an observer reconstructing state from L≤n.
Theorem 27 (Late-Joiner Equivalence). All observers replaying L≤n reconstruct identical kernel states.
Proof. Immediate from replay determinism.
G.6
Fork Semantics
Definition 73 (Explicit Fork). A fork occurs only if two events reference the same σin with incompatible
outputs.
38

Theorem 28 (No Implicit Forking). Forks cannot arise without explicit event divergence in L.
Proof. Sequential replay enforces a single outcome unless separate events encode divergence.
G.7
Causality and Order Independence
Lemma 9 (Local Commutativity). Two events ei, ej commute iff:
σout(ei) ∩σout(ej) = ∅.
Theorem 29 (Causal Consistency). Reordering commuting events yields equivalent kernel states.
G.8
Impossibility Results
Theorem 30 (No State Rewrite). There exists no event sequence that rewrites prior kernel state without
leaving a trace in L.
Theorem 31 (No Hidden Authority). No identity can alter kernel state without producing a valid event.
G.9
Consequences
[Auditability] All semantic state changes admit finite audit trails.
[Deterministic Social Memory] Social state is fully reconstructible from the event log.

(number of semantic objects)
k = max
σ
|Pσ|
(max provenance size)
ρ = max
σ,ϵ ρ(σ, ϵ)
(max local density)
m = |L|
(event log length)

(identities).
H.2
Transformation Validation
Theorem 32 (Transformation Validation Complexity). Validating a semantic transformation has time
complexity
O(k)
and space complexity
O(1).
39

Proof. Validation requires checking modality completeness and provenance monotonicity, each linear
in provenance size.
H.3
Entropy Evaluation
Theorem 33 (Entropy Evaluation Complexity). Computing E(σ) has complexity
O(|Cσ|).
[Incremental Entropy Update] Under bounded transformations,
∆E = O(1).
H.4
Neighborhood Queries
Definition 74 (Neighborhood Query). A neighborhood query returns
Nϵ(σ).
Theorem 34 (Neighborhood Query Complexity). Using approximate nearest neighbor indexing, neigh-
borhood queries execute in
O(log n + ρ).
H.5
Navigation Paths
Definition 75 (Traversal Length). Let ℓbe the length of a navigation path.
Proposition 15 (Traversal Cost). Navigation cost is
O(ℓ(log n + ρ)).
—
H.6
Replay and Reconstruction
Theorem 35 (Replay Complexity). Replaying an event log prefix of length m has time complexity
O(mk).
[Checkpointed Replay] With periodic snapshots, replay complexity reduces to
O((m −m0)k)
for nearest checkpoint m0.
40

H.7
Feed-Based Ranking Comparison
Definition 76 (Feed Ranking). A feed ranking step computes a total order over candidate items.
Theorem 36 (Feed Ranking Complexity). Feed ranking requires
Ω(n log n)
per recomputation.
Theorem 37 (Global Recompute Impossibility). Continuous feed ranking yields superlinear system-wide
cost as n →∞.
H.8
Locality Scaling Law
Theorem 38 (Locality Scaling). Total system load scales as
O(u · ρ)
independent of n.
Proof. Users interact only within bounded neighborhoods.
H.9
Memory Complexity
Theorem 39 (Structural Sharing Bound). Total storage cost is
O(n + mk)
with persistent structure sharing.
H.10
Consequences
[No Global Bottlenecks] No operation requires full-system traversal.
[Asymptotic Stability] System performance remains stable under unbounded growth.
I
Structural Impossibility Results
I.1
Preliminaries
Assume the semantic system (Σ, P, E, ϕ) defined in Appendices A-H, with:
Σ semantic objects,
P provenance DAGs,
E entropy functional,
ϕ : Σ →X.
41

I.2
Impossibility of Global Feeds
Definition 77 (Global Feed). A global feed is a total order
≺F ⊂Σ × Σ
intended to represent relevance across all semantic objects.
Theorem 40 (Feed Impossibility). There exists no ≺F such that:
σ1 ≺F σ2 ⇒d(ϕ(σ1), ϕ(σ2)) ≤ϵ
∀σ1, σ2.
Proof. Total orders require comparability across arbitrarily distant neighborhoods, violating locality
constraints in X.
I.3
Impossibility of Viral Amplification
Definition 78 (Viral Amplification). Viral amplification is the process of increasing visibility without
increasing semantic structure.
Theorem 41 (No Viral Amplification). There exists no admissible transformation sequence (Tk) such that:
E(Tn(σ)) ≤E(σ)
and
visibility(Tn(σ)) →∞.
Proof. Visibility increase without structural information violates entropy bounds.
I.4
Impossibility of Reputation Laundering
Definition 79 (Reputation Laundering). Reputation laundering is the increase of trust T(u) without cor-
responding semantic persistence.
Theorem 42 (No Reputation Laundering). There exists no sequence of admissible transformations increas-
ing T(u) while keeping π(σ) bounded.
Proof. Trust depends monotonically on persistence and entropy stability.
I.5
Impossibility of Hidden Moderation
Definition 80 (Hidden Moderation). Hidden moderation is the alteration or suppression of semantic ob-
jects without explicit provenance.
Theorem 43 (No Hidden Moderation). Hidden moderation is impossible.
Proof. All state transitions require explicit events in the log.
42

I.6
Impossibility of Shadow Banning
Definition 81 (Shadow Banning). Shadow banning is selective visibility reduction without semantic trans-
formation.
Theorem 44 (No Shadow Banning). There exists no admissible operator that selectively reduces accessi-
bility without altering provenance.
Proof. Accessibility is a function of spatial position, not ranking.
I.7
Impossibility of Engagement Optimization
Definition 82 (Engagement Metric). An engagement metric is a function
g : Σ →R
optimized independently of semantic structure.
Theorem 45 (No Engagement Objective). There exists no engagement objective compatible with entropy-
bounded evolution.
Proof. Engagement maximization incentivizes entropy increase.
I.8
Impossibility of Attention Extraction
Definition 83 (Attention Extraction). Attention extraction is the unbounded consumption of user attention
without semantic gain.
Theorem 46 (Attention Conservation). For any user u,
∫∞
0
Au(t) dt < ∞.
I.9
Impossibility of Meaning Collapse
Definition 84 (Meaning Collapse). Meaning collapse is the convergence of semantic objects toward indis-
tinguishable content.
Theorem 47 (No Meaning Collapse). Entropy-bounded evolution prevents semantic homogenization.
I.10
Separation Theorem
Theorem 48 (Architectural Separation). The coherence-first semantic architecture is not a refinement of
feed-based platforms, but is structurally disjoint from them.
Proof. Feed-based systems require global ranking and engagement optimization, both of which are
impossible under the constraints established above.
43

I.11
Final Corollaries
[No Ad-Based Incentive Compatibility] Advertising optimization is incompatible with semantic coher-
ence.
[Time Recovery] User time expenditure produces persistent semantic value.
