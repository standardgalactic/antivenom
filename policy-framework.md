# A Policy Framework for Sustainable Digital Infrastructure  
## From Cognitive Collapse to Cooperative Ownership

---

## Executive Summary

The defining challenges of our digital age—misinformation, platform monopolies, and widespread cognitive fatigue—are not isolated failures. They arise from a shared architectural flaw: the suppression of event history. By privileging ephemeral, state-based views over durable records of construction and commitment, dominant platforms undermine accountability, user agency, and long-term reasoning.

This document proposes a sustainable alternative grounded in three principles:

1. **Authoritative History** — systems built on append-only, replayable event logs  
2. **Cooperative Economics** — pricing aligned with true informational cost (entropy)  
3. **User Sovereignty** — interfaces that support interruption, branching, and repair  

Together, these principles form a policy and design framework for resilient digital infrastructure.

## 1. The Architectural Roots of the Digital Crisis

### 1.1 Cognitive Collapse by Design

Human cognition is event-driven and historical. Meaning depends on how a state was reached, not merely on its present form. Contemporary platforms systematically suppress this structure.

Examples include:
- Non-selectable text that prevents quotation, recomposition, or annotation
- Feed-based interfaces that enforce a single dominant continuation
- Ephemeral content that discourages long-horizon reasoning

These systems function as **single-threaded attention pipelines**, training users away from interruption, recombination, and reflection.

### 1.2 Information Feudalism and Artificial Scarcity

Modern platforms impose scarcity where none technically exists. Despite collapsing storage costs, users are charged volume-based rents that force premature deletion of personal history.

This produces a **cognitive tax**: users must compress or erase their own records to satisfy arbitrary constraints, externalizing infrastructural cost onto human memory.

### 1.3 The Same Failure in AI Systems

Autoregressive AI systems reproduce this flaw. They are fluent but history-blind, lacking any distinction between speculative continuation and committed structure. They cannot make irreversible commitments, only probabilistic guesses.

This explains failures such as:
- Long-horizon incoherence
- Brittle planning
- Confident violations of physical or logical constraints

## 2. Principles for Sustainable Digital Infrastructure

### 2.1 Authoritative History

A sustainable system must treat history as primary.

- All changes are appended as events
- Current state is derived by deterministic replay
- Illegal transitions are impossible, not merely discouraged

This enforces accountability and makes provenance inspectable by construction.

> Intelligence requires machinery that can distinguish a *view* from a *commitment*.

### 2.2 Cooperative Economics via Entropy-Aligned Pricing

Storage cost should scale with **new information introduced**, not redundant copies.

Key mechanisms:
- **Content-addressable storage** (identical data stored once)
- **Delta compression** (only differences stored)

Users who contribute compressible or shared data reduce global cost and should be rewarded. Infrastructure efficiency becomes a cooperative, positive-sum process.

---

### 2.3 User Sovereignty and the Right to History

Interfaces must support agency, not dependency.

Required guarantees:
- The right to interrupt and branch history
- The ability to recombine past work
- Transparent, legible system behavior

Tools like Vim, tmux/Byobu, and programmable input systems demonstrate that sovereignty scales.

The criminalization of tinkering is an architectural choice, not a necessity.

## 3. A Reference Model: Event-First Infrastructure

A system implementing these principles exhibits:

- Append-only event logs
- Deterministic replay
- Invariant-preserving updates
- Content-based addressing
- Structural portability

Data is identified by **what it is**, not **where it lives**, making exit and federation structural properties rather than policy concessions.

## 4. Policy Recommendations

### 4.1 For Policymakers

- Regulate architecture, not just content
- Mandate true data portability based on content addressing
- Protect the right to tinker and inspect personal history

### 4.2 For Technologists

- Prefer event-sourced designs over state mutation
- Build composable, inspectable interfaces
- Replace artificial scarcity with entropy-aligned economics

## 5. Conclusion: Reclaiming Cognitive Infrastructure

Digital fragility is not accidental. Systems that erase history inevitably erode agency, trust, and understanding.

A sustainable digital society requires:
- Respect for irreversible construction
- Economic models aligned with reality
- Interfaces that treat users as participants, not endpoints

The right to history—the right to branch, repair, and understand how we arrived here—is the foundation of a resilient, intelligent digital commons.
