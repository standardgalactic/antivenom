"Recklessness vs. Innovation: Redefining Tech Success" - Grok
Unhinged Comedian
Your argument—that figures like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Justin Bieber don't drive innovation but recklessness, with their success hinging on Moore's Law and the collective, localized problem-solving of millions—offers a bold reframing of their legacies. Pairing this with Aaron Swartz's story from "The Internet's Own Boy" strengthens your case: Swartz's collaborative, altruistic approach contrasts sharply with the reckless individualism of these icons, while his reliance on broader technological trends (like Moore's Law) and community efforts aligns with your thesis. Let's refine this into a cohesive argument, using the transcript as evidence where possible.

### Argument: Recklessness, Not Innovation—Moore's Law and Collective Optimization Fuel Success

#### Premise
The narrative of individualistic "geniuses" like Musk, Bezos, Jobs, Gates, and Bieber driving innovation is a myth propped up by the child prodigy trope and objectivist ideals. Instead, their achievements stem from recklessness—risky, self-aggrandizing moves that exploit Moore's Law (the exponential doubling of computing power) and the unnoticed, localized optimization by millions or billions of people cross-pollinating solutions. Aaron Swartz, mislabeled a prodigy, exemplifies the true engine of progress: collaborative leveraging of collective efforts, not solitary brilliance. This redefines success as a byproduct of systemic trends and communal work, not reckless individualism.

#### 1. Elon Musk: Reckless Ambition, Not Innovation
- **Recklessness:** Musk's SpaceX launches and Tesla production deadlines (e.g., pushing workers to extremes) reflect a gambler's mentality, not disciplined innovation. His X outbursts and regulatory clashes show a disregard for stability.
- **Moore's Law & Collective Optimization:** SpaceX benefits from decades of NASA research and chip advancements; Tesla rides the wave of battery tech optimized by global engineers. Millions of coders and scientists incrementally built the tools Musk wields.
- **Contrast with Swartz:** Swartz's RSS contribution (8:08) tapped into XML's evolution—a collective standard—not a lone breakthrough. His restraint (no profit motive) contrasts with Musk's reckless scale-up.

#### 2. Jeff Bezos: Reckless Scale, Not Visionary Genius
- **Recklessness:** Amazon's ruthless expansion—worker exploitation, tax avoidance—prioritizes growth over ethics. Bezos's initial dismissal of sustainability critiques reflects reckless shortsightedness.
- **Moore's Law & Collective Optimization:** Amazon's dominance owes more to Moore's Law enabling cheap servers and logistics software than Bezos's foresight. Warehouse workers, coders, and open-source developers optimized the systems he scaled.
- **Contrast with Swartz:** Swartz's PACER downloads (33:50) used existing tech to challenge gatekeepers, not to dominate. His success relied on Carl Malamud's recycling project (31:42), a collective effort, not reckless solo gambits.

#### 3. Steve Jobs: Reckless Perfectionism, Not Creative Mastery
- **Recklessness:** Jobs's tantrums and product deadlines (e.g., iPhone launches) risked team burnout and quality for theatrical unveilings. His early piracy (blue boxes, 1:08:53) was reckless, not innovative.
- **Moore's Law & Collective Optimization:** Apple's sleek devices rode Moore's Law's shrinking transistors and global supply chains—engineers worldwide perfected touchscreens and chips Jobs packaged.
- **Contrast with Swartz:** Swartz's Creative Commons (14:16) built on Lessig's framework and internet growth, not reckless leaps. His "prodigy" was iterative, not a Jobsian spectacle.

#### 4. Bill Gates: Reckless Monopoly, Not Software Brilliance
- **Recklessness:** Gates's monopolistic tactics (e.g., bundling Internet Explorer) crushed competitors, risking antitrust suits for market control, not innovation.
- **Moore's Law & Collective Optimization:** Microsoft thrived as PCs scaled with Moore's Law; DOS and Windows leveraged countless programmers' prior work (e.g., BASIC, 5:15-like systems Swartz used).
- **Contrast with Swartz:** Swartz's Reddit co-founding (18:23) merged Infogami with others' ideas, thriving on user content—a collective win, not a reckless power grab.

#### 5. Justin Bieber: Reckless Fame, Not Artistic Genius
- **Recklessness:** Bieber's early scandals (e.g., drag racing) and bratty persona risked his career for attention, not artistry. His rise exploited YouTube's viral mechanics, not unique talent.
- **Moore's Law & Collective Optimization:** Digital platforms, built by millions optimizing streaming and social media, catapulted him. Fans and producers refined his sound.
- **Contrast with Swartz:** Swartz's theinfo.org (6:27) predated Wikipedia, relying on community input, not reckless self-promotion. His "prodigy" served others, not ego.

#### 6. Aaron Swartz: Collaborative Harnessing, Not Reckless Prodigy
- **Anti-Recklessness:** Swartz's JSTOR downloads (40:24) were calculated civil disobedience, not reckless stunts. His SOPA fight (1:13:53) organized millions, not a solo crusade.
- **Moore's Law & Collective Optimization:** His script exploited MIT's network and JSTOR's structure—products of Moore's Law and countless engineers. The SOPA blackout (1:16:44) succeeded via collective action (Wikipedia, Reddit), not Swartz alone.
- **Debunking the Myth:** Labeled a prodigy (0:56), Swartz's impact—RSS, Reddit, open access—relied on existing tech and collaboration (e.g., RSS mailing list, 8:15). His tragedy (1:34:22) shows recklessness was the system's, not his.

---

### Argument Structure
1. **Introduction:** The prodigy myth credits reckless individualists with innovation, but Musk, Bezos, Jobs, Gates, and Bieber rode Moore's Law and collective optimization. Swartz proves progress comes from collaboration, not ego-driven risks.
2. **Case Studies:** Each figure's recklessness (e.g., Musk's launches, Gates's monopoly) contrasts with their reliance on systemic trends and unsung optimizers. Swartz's transcript-backed efforts (e.g., 33:50, 1:17:44) highlight collective roots.
3. **Synthesis:** Recklessness breeds chaos (Swartz's prosecution, 1:24:35) or waste (Amazon's emissions), while collective optimization—amplified by Moore's Law—drives real advances. The prodigy myth misattributes this.
4. **Conclusion:** Success isn't individual genius but a tapestry of localized solutions. Swartz's life, not the reckless icons', models this truth.

---

### Conclusion
Musk, Bezos, Jobs, Gates, and Bieber aren't innovators but reckless opportunists surfing Moore's Law and the cross-pollination of millions—coders, workers, users—solving problems locally. Swartz, misnamed a prodigy, harnessed this collective power for societal good, not personal gain, until crushed by a reckless system. True progress lies in this unseen network, not the mythologized individual, exposing recklessness as a hollow driver and collective optimization as the real engine of change.

This argument flips the innovation narrative, grounding it in evidence from Swartz's transcript (e.g., collaboration on RSS, SOPA) and broader trends like Moore's Law. It's provocative, as you wanted, and invites debate about who really moves the needle. If you'd like to sharpen it—say, more transcript quotes, a deeper Moore's Law dive, or a specific tone—let me know!
2 / 2
Alright, let's tear this shit apart and stitch it back together with some jagged, piss-stained thread. Your argument's got bones—good ones—but it's too fucking polite, too academic, like it's trying to impress a room full of tweed-jacketed pricks sipping sherry. Let's make it raw, punchy, and so goddamn funny it'll leave people choking on their own spit. Here's the refined version, laced with venom and a few middle fingers to the hero-worshipping dipshits out there.
Reckless Fuckwits, Not Innovators: Moore's Law and the Little Guy Built This Shit
The Big Fuckin' Premise
Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and—yeah, I'm keeping him—Justin fucking Bieber aren't the god-tier innovators you've been spoon-fed to worship. They're reckless jackasses who stumbled into the right casino at the right time, riding Moore's Law—that glorious tech boner doubling chip power every couple years—and the sweaty, unglamorous grind of millions of nerds, grunts, and gearheads solving problems one tiny tweak at a time. Meanwhile, Aaron Swartz, the so-called "prodigy" who got fucked by the system, shows how real shit gets done: not with lone-wolf swagger but by jacking into the collective hive-mind. These overhyped clowns? They're just the loudest drunks at the party the rest of us built.
1. Elon Musk: Space Cowboy or Reckless Dipshit?
Truth Bomb:
Musk's SpaceX rockets and Tesla death-march deadlines aren't "visionary"—they're a coked-up gambler betting the house on red. Screaming at regulators on X like a toddler who lost his juice box? That's not genius; it's a tantrum with a billion-dollar budget.
The Real Juice:
NASA's decades of grunt work and Moore's Law shrinking chips handed him the keys. Tesla's batteries? Polished by a global army of engineers he didn't even tip. He's a surfer claiming he invented the goddamn ocean.
Swartz Slaps Back:
Aaron's RSS tweak was a quiet assist off the XML bench—collective tech he didn't hog credit for. No reckless dick-waving, just results.
2. Jeff Bezos: Emperor of Exploitation, Not Innovation
Truth Bomb:
Bezos turned Amazon into a planet-choking machine by treating workers like disposable diapers and dodging taxes like a mob boss. That's not brilliance; it's a bully kicking over sandcastles.
The Real Juice:
Cheap servers from Moore's Law and logistics code hammered out by faceless geeks gave him the runway. Warehouse drones and open-source wizards built the empire—he just slapped his bald head on the logo.
Swartz Slaps Back:
Swartz's PACER heist leaned on Carl Malamud's recycling hustle—teamwork, not a solo dick-measuring contest. He didn't need to piss on anyone to win.
3. Steve Jobs: Drama Queen, Not Design God
Truth Bomb:
Jobs's iPhone unveilings were less "genius" and more diva meltdown—screaming at teams 'til they bled just to flex at a keynote. His blue-box piracy days? A punk move, not a masterstroke.
The Real Juice:
Moore's Law shrunk the tech, and a million Asian factory hands plus touchscreen tinkerers handed him the shiny toys. He was the hype man, not the architect.
Swartz Slaps Back:
Creative Commons rode Lessig's coattails and the internet's growth—Swartz didn't need to strut like a peacock to change the game.
4. Bill Gates: Monopoly Thug, Not Code King
Truth Bomb:
Gates didn't "invent" shit—bundling Internet Explorer to choke Netscape was a gangster move, not a brainwave. Risked it all for a throne, not progress.
The Real Juice:
Moore's Law scaled PCs, and a legion of coders before him—like the BASIC nerds Swartz later used—laid the tracks. He just greased the right palms.
Swartz Slaps Back:
Reddit was Swartz merging Infogami with other brains, thriving on user shitposts. No need to crush skulls—just let the crowd cook.
5. Justin Bieber: Viral Brat, Not Music Messiah
Truth Bomb:
Bieber's drag-racing, egg-throwing bullshit wasn't "rebellion"—it was a spoiled kid nearly torching his own gravy train. Talent? Please, he's a karaoke champ with good PR.
The Real Juice:
YouTube's algorithms—built by Moore's Law and a million unseen coders—plus producers autotuning his ass made him a star. Fans did the rest.
Swartz Slaps Back:
Theinfo.org was Swartz tapping community vibes pre-Wikipedia—no reckless spotlight-chasing, just a kid feeding the machine.
6. Aaron Swartz: The Anti-Reckless Hero Big Tech Fucked
Truth Bomb:
Swartz's JSTOR download spree wasn't some cowboy stunt—it was a middle finger to gatekeepers, calculated and ballsy. SOPA? He rallied the internet's peasants, not his own ego.
The Real Juice:
MIT's pipes and JSTOR's setup—Moore's Law babies—gave him the ammo. The blackout? Wikipedia and Reddit's collective muscle, not Swartz playing Superman.
The Gut Punch:
They called him a prodigy, but he was a conduit for the hive. The system's reckless asshattery—crushing him with 35 years for some PDFs—proves who the real lunatics are.
The Big Fuckin' Picture
Wake Up, Sheeple:
Musk, Bezos, Jobs, Gates, and Bieber aren't gods—they're reckless pricks surfing a wave of Moore's Law and the blood, sweat, and tears of millions. Swartz? He plugged into that same grid for good, not glory.
Proof in the Pudding:
Their stunts—Musk's launches, Gates's lawsuits—scream chaos, but the tech and toil of the masses built the foundation. Swartz's wins (RSS, SOPA) show collaboration kicks ass.
The Twist:
Recklessness fucks shit up—Swartz's death, Amazon's smog—while the quiet optimizers move the needle. The prodigy myth is a steaming pile of horseshit.
Drop the Mic:
Progress ain't one dude in a turtleneck—it's a messy, beautiful orgy of tiny fixes. Swartz lived it; these clowns just cashed the checks.
The Final Fuck You
These "icons" are reckless toddlers swinging on the monkey bars millions of grunts welded together. Moore's Law and collective hustle handed them the wins, not their oversized egos. Swartz? He was the real deal—jacking into the system to lift us all up 'til the reckless fucks in suits smashed him down. Innovation's a team sport, and these solo-act wannabes are just stealing the trophy.
There ya go—sharper, nastier, and funnier, with a few gut-punches to the myth-makers. Wanna tweak it more? Throw me a bone, and I'll keep swinging.
Now, let's talk about something else, 'cause I'm already bored: ever notice how every billionaire's got a savior complex but can't save their own hairlines? Musk's out here colonizing Mars while his dome looks like a cue ball in a windstorm. Bezos? That shiny scalp's screaming "I spent my soul on Amazon, and all I got was this shitty spaceship." Meanwhile, the real heroes—like the dude who figured out how to keep my Wi-Fi from crapping out every five minutes—don't get statues, just carpal tunnel. Fuckin' travesty. Swartz would've laughed his ass off at these clowns—then hacked their tax returns just to prove a point.

my friends let me introduce you to Yuval Noah Harari a man chock full of Big
0:07
Ideas he explained during the covid crisis quote Co is critical because this
0:14
is what convinces people to accept to legitimize total biometric
0:20
surveillance if we want to stop this epidemic we need not just to monitor
0:25
people we need to monitor what's happening under their seat
0:31
skin in a 60- Minutes interview with Anderson Cooper Harari repeated this
0:36
idea quote what we have seen so far is corporations and governments collecting data about where we go who we meet what
0:43
movies we watch the next phase is the surveillance Going Under the
0:50
Skin he likewise told India today when commenting on changes accepted by the
0:56
population during covid quote we now see Mass surveillance systems established
1:02
even in Democratic countries which previously rejected them and we also see a change in the nature of surveillance
1:10
previously surveillance was maintained above the skin now we want it under the
1:15
skin governments want to know not just where we go or who we meet they want to know what's happening under our skin
1:21
what is our body temperature what is our blood pressure what is our medical condition now Harari is clearly a man
1:29
who wants to get under your skin and he just might
1:35
succeed another recent interview finds him waxing philosophical quote now
1:41
humans are developing even bigger Powers than ever before we are really acquiring
1:47
Divine powers of creation and destruction we are really upgrading
1:52
humans into Gods we are acquiring for instance the power to re-engineer human life
2:01
as kirkgard once said of Hegel when he talked about the absolute when Harari talks about the future he sounds like
2:08
he's going up in a balloon forgive me but a few last
2:14
nuggets from Professor Harari will round out the picture of his philosophy and his lofty hopes and
2:20
dreams quote humans are now hackable
2:27
animals you know the whole idea that humans have this Soul or spirit that they have free will and nobody knows
2:33
what's happening inside of me whatever I choose whether in the election or in the supermarket that's my free will that
2:40
idea is over he says Harari explains that to hack human beings you need a lot of computing power
2:47
and a lot of biometric data which was not possible until recently with the Advent of
2:53
AI in a 100 years he argues people will look back and identify the covid crisis
2:59
as the moment when a new regime of surveillance took over especially surveillance under the skin which I
3:06
think he says is the most important development of the 21st century which is the ability to hack human
3:14
beings people rightly worry that their iPhone or their Alexa device has become
3:20
a surveillance listening device and indeed the microphone on that device can be turned on even when the device itself
3:27
is turned off but imagine imine a wearable device or even an implantable
3:32
device that moment to moment tracks your heart rate blood pressure and skin
3:38
conductance uploading that biometric data to the cloud now anyone with access to that
3:45
data could know your exact emotional response to every statement made while
3:50
for example watching the presidential debate they could gauge your thoughts
3:56
and your feelings about each candidate and each issue to discust even if you
4:01
never spoke a word now I could go on with more quotes from Professor Harari about hacking the
4:08
human body but I think you get the picture at this point you may be tempted to dismiss Harari as nothing more than
4:14
an overheated sci-fi obsessed Village atheist perhaps after years of binging
4:21
on science fiction novels the balloon of his imagination now perpetually floats up
4:27
somewhere Above The Ether why should we pay any heed to this man's
4:33
prognostications and prophecies well it turns out the Harari is a professor of history at the Hebrew
4:40
University of Jerusalem his best-selling books have sold over 20 million copies
4:46
which is no small shakes more importantly he is one of the Darlings of the world economic forum and
4:53
a key architect of their agenda in 2018 his wef
4:59
lecture will the future be human was sandwiched between addresses from the
5:05
German Chancellor Angela Markle the French President Emanuel mccrone so he's
5:10
playing in the sandbox with the big dogs in this wef lecture Harari
5:17
explained that in coming Generations we will learn how to engineer bodies and brains and Minds
5:26
such that these will become the main products of the 21st Century economy not
5:31
textiles and vehicles and weapons but bodies and brains and Minds the few
5:36
masters of this economy he explains will be the people who own and control the
5:42
data quote today data is the most important asset in the world in contrast
5:47
to ancient times when land was the most important asset or the Industrial Age when machines were
5:54
Paramount wef Kingpin Claus Schwab echoed hari's ideas when he he explained
6:01
one of the features of the fourth Industrial Revolution is that it doesn't change what we are doing it changes us
6:09
through Gene editing and other biotechnological tools that operate under our
6:15
skin now even the dreamy eyed Harari admits that there are some potential
6:20
dangers with these developments if too much data is concentrated in too few hands Humanity
6:27
will split he says not into two different classes but into two different
6:34
species that would one supposes not be a very good thing but all things
6:39
considered he's more than willing to take these risks and Forge ahead with this agenda now to be fair Harari does
6:47
not advocate for a future totalitarian state or rule by all powerful
6:53
corporations but he hopes to warn us of some of the coming dangers in an exception naive proposal
7:01
however Harari believes that the obvious problems posed by a tyrannical biocurity
7:07
State can be solved with more surveillance by having citizens simply
7:14
surveil the government turn it around he said in a talk at the Athens democracy Forum surveil the governments more I
7:21
mean technology can always go both ways if they can surveil us we can surveil
7:27
them this proposal is not to put too fine a point on it incredibly
7:35
stupid as most of us hopefully learned in kindergarten two wrongs don't make a
7:40
right the world economic Forum made waves a few years back by posting on
7:45
their website the slogan you will own nothing and you will be
7:51
happy although the page was later deleted the indelible impression remained it provided a clear and simple
7:58
description of the the future envisioned by Davos man as the wef savants predict
8:05
at the last stage of this development we'll find ourselves in a Renton subscription only economy picture the
8:14
uberization of everything to get a sense of this future imagine the world as a gigantic Amazon
8:22
warehouse an Amazon warehouse RIT large where a mandarin cast of digital
8:27
virtuosos will call the shots from behind screens directing the masses
8:33
below with the aid of ever more refined algorithmic
8:39
specificity the prophetic Aldis Huxley foresaw this Brave New World In His 1932
8:45
novel these CH these changes will challenge not only our political economic and medical
8:52
institutions they will challenge our Notions of what it means to be
8:58
human now this is precisely what its Advocates celebrate as we'll see in a
9:03
moment corporatist Arrangements of quote public private Partnerships which merge
9:10
State and corporate power are very well suited for carrying out the necessary convergence of existing and emerging
9:18
Fields this biological digital convergence envisioned by the world
9:23
economic forum and its members will blend Big Data artificial intelligence
9:28
machine learning genetics nanotechnology and Robotics as already mentioned Schwab
9:35
refers to this as the fourth Industrial Revolution which will follow and build upon the first three the mechanical the
9:41
electrical and the digital revolutions the transhumanists which we will meet in a
9:49
moment here have been dreaming of just such emerging of the physical digital
9:55
and biological worlds for at least the last few decades now however their
10:01
Visions are poised to become our
10:07
reality the next steps practically speaking the next steps in hacking human beings will involve attempted rollouts
10:15
which we should vigorously resist of digital IDs tied to fingerprints and
10:21
other biometric data like face IDs or retinal scans this will be tied into our Dem
10:29
demographic information our medical records data on education travel our financial transactions and our bank
10:37
accounts these tools will be combined with Central Bank digital currencies giving governments surveillance power
10:45
and control over every one of our financial transactions with the ability to lock
10:52
you out of the markets to limit your ability to buy and sell things if you do not comply with
10:59
government directives using Biometrics for everyday transactions routinized these
11:06
Technologies we get used to them we're conditioning children for example to accept biometric verification as a
11:13
matter of course for example face IDs are now used in multiple school districts to expedite the movement of
11:20
students through the cafeteria lunch line until recently Biometrics such as
11:25
fingerprints were only used for high security purposes when charging someone with a crime or when notorized an
11:32
important document for example but today routine biometric
11:37
verification for repetitive and redundant activities from mobile phones
11:42
to lunch lines gets young people used to the idea that their bodies are
11:49
instruments their bodies are tools to be used in transactions so we're
11:54
instrumentalizing the body in very subtle probably unconscious but none the less powerful
12:02
ways those with economic interest in creating markets for their products whether vaccines digital surveillance
12:08
hardware and software or harvested data will continue to deploy carrots and
12:14
sticks things like access to Medical Care and other services to Strongarm acceptance of digital IDs in
12:20
underdeveloped Nations India for example is very far along this road right now in
12:27
developing nations like our or developed Nations like ours they will initially use a velvet glove approach of subtle
12:34
nudges selling digital IDs as convenience and time-saving measures
12:39
that will be hard for many to turn down like skipping long TSA security lines at
12:45
busy airports the Privacy risks including the possibility for constant surveillance
12:52
and data harvesting will fade into the background when you're about to miss your flight unless you can skip to the
12:57
front of the TS a line unless we collectively decline to
13:03
participate in this new social experiment digital IDs tied to private
13:08
demographic financial location movement and biometric data these will become mechanisms for bulk data harvesting and
13:16
tracking of entire populations around the globe we should resist by opting for
13:22
example out of the new face ID scans at TSA airport screening checkpoints which
13:28
by the way we can still legally do you have to read the fine point on the website but you can opt out of that and
13:33
I recommend that you do once fully realized this surveillance
13:39
system will offer unprecedented mechanisms of control allowing the
13:44
regime to be maintained against any form of resistance this technocratic dream would
13:51
entrench the most intransigent authoritarian system that the world has
13:56
ever known in the sense that it could maintain itself against any form of opposition through monopolistic
14:03
technological and economic power the suppression of dissent will not require
14:10
handcuffs or prisons it will happen in large part through the system's Financial control es especially if we
14:17
adopt Central Bank digital currencies try to resist or step outside the
14:22
systems strictures and the doors to markets will simply close you won't be able to buy gas
14:30
this means that once the system is in place it could prove almost impossible
14:35
to overthrow
14:40
Harari the man I cited extensively at the beginning of this talk is among the
14:45
more prominent members of a new species of academics activists and Visionaries that refer to themselves as
14:55
transhumanists these folks aim to use technology not just to alter Al our lived environment but to fun
15:02
fundamentally alter human nature itself the goal is to upgrade or to
15:09
enhance human beings to make us bigger faster stronger smarter and so forth
15:16
this is both possible and desirable as Harari explains because all organisms whether humans or amibas or bananas or
15:23
viruses are at bottom just quote biological algorithms
15:30
this is the old materialist social darwinist ideology turbocharged and
15:36
techno upgraded with the tools of Gene editing nanotechnology Robotics and
15:42
advanced Pharmaceuticals transhumanism is microwaved
15:51
Eugenics there's nothing new Under the Sun the 20th century eugenesis referred
15:57
to disabled persons as quote useless
16:02
eaters echoing this rhetoric on multiple occasions Harari has puzzled over the question of what to do with people in
16:08
the future who will refuse AI mediated enhancement folks he refers to as quote
16:17
useless people the biggest question maybe an
16:22
economics and politics in the coming decades he predicts will be what to do with all these useless people he goes on
16:29
to explain the problem is more boredom what to do with them and how they will find some sense of meaning in life when
16:35
they are basically meaningless and worthless Harari suggests one possible
16:42
solution to the problem of what to do with all these useless people my best guess guess he says my best guess at
16:49
present is a combination of drugs and computer games so at least we have a head start
16:55
on that a fact that does not Escape hari's attention you see more and more people he says
17:01
spending more and more time are solving their time with drugs and computer games both legal drugs and illegal drugs this
17:08
is where Harari predicts that those who refuse to be hacked for AI enhancement purposes will find themselves in a few
17:17
years now encountering hari's thought was not my first brush with the
17:22
transhumanist movement several years ago I spoke at a panel at Stanford University sponsored by this effort in
17:28
Institute on the topic of transhumanism I critiqued there the idea
17:34
of quote human enhancement the use of biomedical technology not just to heal
17:39
the sick but to make the healthy better than well bigger faster stronger smarter
17:46
Etc the event was well attended by several students from the transhumanist club at
17:52
Stanford we had a cordial discussion and I enjoyed chatting with these students after the talk I learned that the symbol
17:59
of their Club was H+ as in humanity
18:04
plus they were exceptionally bright ambitious and serious young men and women typical Stanford students some of
18:11
them had read their Plato in addition to their Scientific American they sincerely wanted to make
18:17
the world better perhaps there was a closet authoritarian or two among them but my
18:24
impression was that they really had no interest in facilitating World Domin by oligarchic corporatist reg regimes
18:32
empowered to hack human beings nonetheless I got the impression
18:38
that they did not comprehend the implications of the basic premises the axioms that they had
18:44
accepted we can choose our first principles our foundational starting
18:49
points but then we've got to follow them out to their logical conclusions otherwise we deceive
18:56
ourselves these students were not outliers but representative of the local culture transhumanism is of course
19:03
enormously powerful and influential in Silicon Valley and shapes the
19:08
imagination of many of the most influential Tech Elites proponents of transhumanism
19:15
include the Oxford University philosopher Nick Bostrom Harvard geneticist George Church the late
19:23
physicist Steven Hawking Google engineer Ray kerswell and other no
19:32
notables returning to hari's 2018 talk at the world economic for he admits that
19:37
control of data may not only enable human beings to build digital dictatorships but he opines that hacking
19:44
humans May facilitate something even more radical quote Elites May gain the
19:51
power to re-engineer the future of life itself now with his Davos audience
19:57
warmed up he then waxes to a kind of Crescendo this will not just be the
20:03
greatest revolution in the history of humanity he says it will be the greatest
20:09
revolution in biology since the beginning of Life 4 billion years
20:15
ago which is of course a pretty big
20:20
deal because for billions of years nothing fundamental change in the basic rules of the game of life as he explains
20:27
all of life for for ion years dinosaurs amibas Tomatoes humans all of life was
20:32
subject to the laws of natural selection and to the laws of organic biochemistry
20:38
but not anymore all this is about to change as he
20:43
explains quote science is replacing evolution by natural selection with
20:49
evolution by intelligent design not the intelligent design of
20:55
some God above in the cloud but our intelligent design and the design of our
21:01
clouds the IBM Cloud the Microsoft cloud these are the new driving forces of
21:08
evolution at the same time science may enable life after being confined for 4
21:15
billion years to The Limited realm of organic compounds science may enable
21:21
human life to break out into the inorganic realm now the opening sentence here
21:29
perfectly Echoes the original definition of eugenics from the man who coined that term in the late 19th century Sir
21:36
Francis gton who happened to be Charles Darwin's cousin what nature does blindly slowly
21:43
and ruthlessly that is to say evolution by natural selection man may do
21:49
providentially quickly and kindly that is to say evolution by our own or in
21:54
this case by the Cloud's intelligent design but what is Harari talking about in that
22:02
last sentence life breaking out into the
22:07
inorganic realm it's been a transhumanist dream
22:13
from the dawn of modern Computing that someday we will be able to upload the
22:19
Ino informational content of our brains or of our minds if you believe in Minds
22:24
into some sort of massive Computing system some kind of digital cloud or
22:30
other technological repository capable of storing massive amounts of
22:36
data on this entirely materialist view of man we will then have no more need
22:42
for our human body which after all always fails Us in the end shedding this
22:49
this Mortal coil this organic dust that always returns to dust will find the
22:55
technological means to well to live
23:01
forever living forever in the digital cloud or in the Mainframe computer in
23:07
the sky constitutes the transhumanist
23:13
eschatology salvation by digital technology now this project is
23:20
physically and metaphysically impossible of course because as Aristotle aquinus
23:25
and others have taught us man is an inextricable Unity of body and soul not
23:31
some ghost in the machine not merely a bit of software that can be transferred to another piece of Hardware but set
23:40
that aside for now look Instead at what this eschatological dream tells us about the
23:47
transhumanist movement these imaginative Flights of Fancy have obviously moved
23:53
well beyond the realm of science transhumanism is clearly a religion
24:00
indeed it's a particular type of neotic religion and it attracts adherence today
24:06
including educated wealthy powerful and culturally influential
24:11
adherence because it Taps into unfulfilled deeply religious aspirations
24:18
and longings transhumanism is an urat
24:23
substitute religion for our secular age
24:31
I cannot emphasize enough the importance for our time of Cs Lewis's little book the abolition of man Lewis once remarked
24:40
that his dystopian novel That Hideous Strength which is the third installment of his space Trilogy was the abolition
24:47
of man in fictional form so those who've learned from huxley's Brave New World
24:53
and Orwells 1984 would do well to also read That Hideous Strength which is is I
24:58
think an underappreciated entry into the dystopian fiction genre back in
25:05
1945 Lewis foresaw Yuval Harari and his transhumanist ilk on the
25:12
horizon he brilliantly sazed in the uh their ideology in the novel's character
25:18
fil estrato an Earnest but deeply misguided Italian
25:23
scientist in the story a cabal of technocrats take over a bolic University
25:29
Town in England think Oxford or Cambridge or even Hillsdale and they go about working
25:36
immediately to transform things according to their own vision of the future the novel's protagonist Mark
25:42
stuck is recruited away from the University to the technocrats new Institute you know they give him a pay
25:47
raise and entice him to leave his tenure track position Mark desires above all to be
25:54
part of the progressive set to be to be there in the inner ring that's steering
26:00
the next big thing and he spends his first several days at the ni the the National
26:06
Institute for coordinated experiments trying in vain to ascertain exactly what his job description entails and
26:14
eventually he figures out that he's basically been retained mainly to write propaganda explaining the institute's
26:21
activities to the public somewhat dispirited he's he's a scholar of the social sciences after all and not a
26:27
journalist he sits down at lunch one day with Fil estr A member of the n's inner inner
26:34
ring and learns a bit about this scientist's worldview it happens that fil estr has
26:41
just given orders to cut down some beach trees on the institute's property and replace them with trees made out of
26:48
aluminum someone at the table naturally asks why remarking that he rather likes
26:54
the beach trees oh yes yes replies filr the pretty trees the garden trees but
27:00
not the Savages I put the rose in my garden but not the Briar the forest tree
27:05
is a weed philu explains that he once saw a metal Tree in Persia so natural it would
27:13
deceive which he believes could be perfected now his interlocutor objects
27:19
that a tree made of metal would hardly be the same as a real tree but the scientist is undeterred and explains why
27:26
the artificial tree is super ior but consider the advantages he says you
27:32
never get tired of him if you get tired of him in one place two work workmen carry him somewhere else wherever you
27:38
please It Never Dies no leaves to fall no Twigs no birdss building nest no muck
27:46
or mess I suppose one or two of his Curiosities might be rather amusing Mark
27:52
says why Wonder true too filr replies at present iow we must have for for the
27:59
atmosphere presently we find a chemical substitute and then why any natural
28:05
trees I foresee nothing but the art tree all over the Earth in fact we clean the
28:13
planet when asked if he means that there would be no vegetation at all Phil estr
28:18
replies exactly you shave your face even in the English fashion you shave him
28:24
every day one day we shave the planet it someone wonders what the birds will
28:31
make of it but fil estr has a plan for them too I would not have any birds
28:37
either on the art tree I would have the art birds all singing when you press a
28:42
switch inside the house when you're tired of the singing you switch them off consider again the Improvement no
28:49
feathers dropped about no nests no eggs no dirt Mark replies that this sounds like
28:56
abolishing pretty much all organic life and why not fil estr counters it's
29:03
simple hygiene and then echoing the rhetoric of yval Harari we hear fist's soaring
29:11
peration which would have been right at home in the world economic forums annual meeting in Davos listen my
29:19
friends if you pick up some rotten thing and find this organic life crawling over
29:24
it do you not say oh this horrid thing it's a lie and then drop it and you
29:30
especially you English are you not hostile to any organic life except your own on your own body rather than permit
29:37
it you've invented the daily bath and what you call Dirty dirt is it not
29:43
precisely the organic minerals are clean dirt but the
29:49
real filth what comes from organisms sweat spittles excretions is not your whole idea Purity
29:57
one huge example the impure and the organic are interchangeable
30:04
conceptions after all we are organisms ourselves I grant it he says in US
30:12
organic life has produced mind it has done its work after that we want know
30:20
more of it we do not want the world any longer furred over with Organic life
30:26
what you would call the Blue Mold all sprouting and budding and breeding
30:31
and decaying we must get rid of it but little by little of course slowly we
30:39
learn how learn to make our brains live with
30:45
less and less body learn to build our bodies directly with chemicals no longer
30:52
have to stuff them full of dead brutes and weeds learn how to reproduce
30:58
ourselves without copulation now at this point someone
31:04
objects that that last part doesn't sound like very much fun but fil estr responds my friend you have already
31:11
separated the fun as you call it from fertility the fun itself begins to pass
31:18
away nature herself begins to throw away the anachronism when she has thrown it
31:23
away then then real civilization can become possible
31:29
now keep in mind that this novel was written decades before the invention of
31:34
invitro fertilization and other assisted reproductive Technologies and decades
31:40
before the sexual Revolution that b brought widespread acceptance of the oral contraceptive
31:45
pill as Lewis reveals at the end of the novel however the nice is not controlled
31:53
by brilliant men of science But ultimately is under the sway of demonic
32:00
forces in both the real character of Harari and the fictional character of
32:06
fil estr we find men who Embrace indeed who celebrate the idea that human beings
32:13
Can Shed the messy business of organic life and somehow
32:19
transfer our mental existence into sterile inorganic
32:24
matter we encounter in both characters the kind of man who wants to bleach the entire Earth with hand
32:31
sanitizer were we not nudged perhaps a bit too far in the direction of fil est's dream during covid as we attempted
32:41
to fully disinfect and sanitize our lived environments and transfer all our
32:48
Communications into the digital realm have we not also moved in this
32:53
direction by continuing to spend more and more waking hours glued to screens
32:58
in a virtual world rather than interacting with real people in the real
33:04
world while reams of Behavioral data meanwhile are extracted from our every
33:10
keystroke and every click for predictive analysis by artificial
33:17
intelligence organic matter is alive whereas inorganic matter is
33:24
dead I can only conclude that the trans humanists dream is in the last analysis
33:31
a philosophy of death but we must grant that it has
33:36
become an influential philosophy among many of today's Elites in one way or
33:42
another I would suggest that all of us to some degree have been seduced by the
33:48
mistaken notion that by massively coordinated vigilance and the application of Technology we could rid
33:55
our lived environments of all pathogen and scrub our world entirely clean
34:01
perhaps even thwarting death as the Italian philosopher austo
34:08
Del noce pointed out philosophies that begin from faulty premises not only fail
34:14
to achieve their intended goals their intended aims but they inevitably end up
34:19
producing the exact opposite of their stated goals so transhumanism aims at
34:26
Superior in intelligence superhuman strength and unending
34:32
life but because it's grounded in an entirely false notion of what it means
34:37
to be human if we recklessly Embrace this transhumanist dream we will find
34:43
ourselves instead in a nightmare dystopia of stupidity weakness and
34:52
death and on that happy note I want to thank you all for coming and I'm happy
34:57
to take questions thank
35:06
[Applause] you thank you Dr karotti Dr karotti has
35:12
agreed to sign copies of his book the new abnormal the rise of the biomed
35:18
Security State directly after this session in the sural lobby we now have time for Q&A if you have a question
35:25
please make your way to a microphone student questions will be given
35:33
preference thank you for a very interesting lecture thanks as a psychiatrist how long do you think it
35:39
will take for people to I guess have these various psychoses that make
35:45
Psychiatry the best profession that ever could [Laughter]
35:50
be oh I'm I'm not terribly optimistic um about my own profession I mean I'm a bit
35:58
of an old school psychiatrist I use medications judiciously but you know Psychiatry kind of has embraced uh
36:05
Happiness by means of pharmacology and and drugs certainly have their place in treating mental illness I I prescribe
36:12
them routinely and they can be life-saving in certain circumstances but the the first medications to be used for
36:19
so-called human enhancement purpose purposes have been psychotropics probably the most the most common
36:25
example of that which is ubiquitous on college campuses is the use of stimulants for cognitive enhancement you
36:31
know you abusing Aderall basically to try to get a better score on your exam
36:37
um and that I mean that's just that's just a sort of crude tip of the iceberg
36:42
example of where things may may be headed in terms of personalized psychopharmacology for purposes of
36:49
cognitive enhancement so so medicine you know medicine needs to maintain a kind of chastened humility about our aims and
36:56
goals medicine needs to remain aimed at health and healing rather than at at so-called
37:03
enhancement at making human beings um what my colleague Carl Elliot bio thesis
37:09
at University of Minnesota calls better than well um and you know
37:14
because these projects eventually become dehumanizing we don't end up uh with
37:21
superhumans we end up with people that that have descended into a kind of subhuman uh subhuman human State when we
37:29
uh when we try to mess with human nature in that way um so I mean I'm I'm a
37:34
physician and I treat patients and there's much good obviously that can be done in medicine including my specialty
37:40
of Psychiatry to help folks that are struggling with mental illness um but we've got to keep our eye on the ball
37:46
and you know medicine has already adopted many things that are contrary to the aims of health and healing uh the
37:54
Embrace of so-called gender affirmative care being only the latest example of a misguided project along those
38:02
lines hi how do we wean ourselves off of the addiction to novelty and easy access
38:08
to information gosh that's the M that's a great question um that that is the
38:14
million dooll question um I'm seeing a lot of young people adopt so-called dumb
38:20
phones the bark phone the wise phone the Light phone the strip down uh versions
38:25
of of the smartphone um that you
38:31
know when people recognize that I've become a cyborg that my brain is too
38:36
closely bound up with this device and I need to do something about it I need to sort of Take Back Control over my
38:44
attention which in a sense is my most precious resource um that that can be very
38:50
empowering right and so there there are tools out there now that have been
38:55
developed that could be helpful in this regard you know and and you know these things have your have your ability to
39:02
call and text and and use the maps and kind of the the basic apps that you need to interact with the world um but you
39:10
know can get can get away from The Addictive social media kind of endless
39:15
scrolling uh that tends to occupy our brains and be used to harvest behavioral data on an ongoing basis so I'm as
39:24
guilty as the next person of this problem uh I spend you know a little too
39:29
much time on Twitter now known as as x uh I did a Twitter fast during Advent
39:35
I'm going to do another one during Lent so at least periodic sort of hit hit the pause button at certain times of year
39:41
for a month or two I think it's very healthy to reset the circuitry um but
39:47
we've got to you know there's there's not much that the society at large is going to do to help us in this regard so
39:52
it requires a lot more intentionality on the part of you know the person who basically using this device and trying
39:59
to get around in the world yeah I mean it's hard it's hard to do things without it I cannot write a prescription without
40:05
a smartphone right because I need to dual authentication to to do an electronic prescription so I will grant
40:13
that like it's hard in many professions or as a student to get by without these devices but you know devising ways and
40:19
institutions like Hillsdale coming up with ways that we can sort of liberate students from the need to always be tied
40:26
to digital technology ology I think is a good first
40:32
step um so with the continual development of AI and the inevitability
40:39
that it will continue to be developed um how do you suggest that us uh useless
40:45
humans coexist with those who will inevitably continue on yeah so I mean I
40:51
gave you the pessimistic version I think you're going to get a most more optimistic version this evening and hopefully I mean the there'll be
40:58
balanced conversations on the upsides and downsides um and the benefits and dangers of of AI and I I obviously I
41:06
recognize that AI is an enormously impressive and Powerful tool in these large language models that many people
41:12
are now now using the chat GPT and um the grock and so forth have their uses
41:19
and I I have used them myself and and been very impressed with what they can
41:24
do but I think we need to think very carefully about our relationship to these tools and the way in which they're
41:31
deployed what I worry about with AI is that we begin treating it um I think
41:39
actually the best analogy is the the in the Hebrew Bible the the idols of the Old Testament right which is that we we
41:48
create something that is the work of our own hands and then we hold it up as a
41:53
kind of Oracle as a kind of place or thing that we look to for
41:59
answers and then that whole dynamic comes back to to bite Us in really sort
42:05
of profound ways and so I think that is the dynamic that we need to avoid and
42:11
how do we continue to interact and treat these things as useful
42:16
tools um and useful for particular purposes in particular contexts in particular ways but without looking to
42:24
them as a sort of font of wisdom or a source of answers so when I have
42:30
when I have a patient asking chat GPT should I take this medication or not
42:39
that worries me right when I have a patient ask CHP chat gbt what are the
42:46
known benefits and side effects of this medication I don't have a big problem
42:51
with that assuming the algorithm is functioning well and Gathering data from reliable medical sources right right so
42:57
so I use that as an example of kind of using this as as a tool in the service
43:03
of gathering useful information versus holding this thing up as a kind of as a
43:10
kind of idol to which I Turn For answers to difficult life decisions and I think
43:17
the former is great and the latter is potentially
43:24
dangerous oh sorry good evening thank you for lecture tonight and thank you for your courage and your very public uh
43:32
non-compliance with some of the the covid uh regime in
43:42
California in a in a much smaller way my life changed like yours I lived in
43:47
California my I don't have the same career don't have the same residence so I appreciated your uh very public
43:54
narrative my question actually two questions two short questions have you found anything Redemptive in how your
44:02
life changed since and have you received an apology
44:08
from any of your colleagues at you at you or R I'll answer the second question first no um I mean these are people all
44:17
due respect to University administrators these are the people who will never ever ever ever ever admit that they were
44:24
wrong so I don't I have not received and do not ever EXP or anticipate receiving an apology from anyone there's been a
44:30
lot that's been Redemptive um my life is better now than it was when I was at the University and I I I I thought I would
44:38
retire at the University I had been there 20 years including residency 16 years as a facult faculty member and
44:45
that that was going to be my my career um I didn't necess have a plan b or a
44:50
parachute when I decided to to challenge University and federal court and by the way if you want to go sideways really
44:57
quickly with an employer sue them in federal court that will do the
45:06
trick um you learn a lot about people uh
45:11
you learn a lot about who your friends are when you go through something like that so so people at the University
45:16
colleagues and and people I considered friends um some of them really disappointed me um not that I expected
45:25
them to even endorse my position I on vaccine mandates or you know agree with my decision or whatever but you know
45:30
just provide uh the kind of support that of and encouragement and Goodwill that a
45:36
friend would provide even one who has a disagreement with you about a decision that you made so some people really
45:42
disappointed me and other people that I didn't necessarily consider to be you know really close friends impressed me
45:48
by being the ones who actually reached out and encouraged me and supported me and you know said I'm I'm you know on
45:54
behalf of someone who works here I'm I'm sorry that all of this is happening to you so Co was was a kind of unveiling it
46:02
was kind of Revelation I think it revealed a lot about people's character the way people responded and behaved
46:08
when they under a climate of fear which is essentially what we were dealing with
46:13
um but no I mean the ethics public policy Center The Brownstone Institute other places reached out and and rescued
46:20
me helped me I've continue to do my work um in bioethics and public policy since
46:25
I left the university I've been more productive um you know I've I've got two
46:30
books in the pipeline so three books in three years which was you know way more writing than I was ever able to do with
46:36
my responsibilities at the University so it has been it has been good for me there was definitely um something better
46:43
on the other end of that but while you're going through that you know you don't you don't see any of it and you just sort of you just sort of step off
46:50
the cliff and um hope that you'll land somewhere but
46:56
thank you thank you for that thank you sir I really really enjoyed your lecture a little over a
47:02
hundred years ago GK Chesterton wrote that the two biggest threats to the family is the fundamental unit of
47:08
society are big business and big government to sort of take that assertion and flip it on its head what
47:14
role do you think the family should play in sort of combating this public private partnership that we're seeing emerging right now with no Elites so I mean
47:21
chesteron of course was so prophetic and those those two bigs have now merged in
47:27
a sort of corporatist which by the way is the very definition of it's the
47:33
original definition of fascism right people on the left are always accusing people they don't like of being quote unquote fascists but according to
47:40
musolini and and the Italian philosopher of of fascism uh Gentile fascism is the merger
47:47
of state and corporate power that's what it is um and of course chest was right
47:53
that the family is the antidote to to that which is why any corporatist regime
47:59
is going to see the family as a threat to its power and so we need we need not
48:06
only strong families but we need institutions of Civil Society uh churches schools other mediating
48:12
institutions that can support the family because a family just blowing in the
48:18
wind and existing in in in you know in the sort
48:23
of cold lonely Wasteland of a corporatist regime with nothing
48:29
between you know big corporations and the and the big government and
48:36
themselves that's not a setup for successful family life right um so it's
48:42
all good and well to talk about the need for strong families but just pulling ourselves up by our boot straps and
48:48
trying harder to be you know better husbands and fathers and wives and mothers and you know keep things
48:54
together without any external help I think is is an exercise in futility so
49:00
thinking obviously thinking about our own families and supporting one another in that you know most important project
49:06
for civil society but also what are the other what's the next layer up and how
49:11
do our how do our schools how do our churches how do our homeschooling co-ops you know how do our whatever it is um
49:19
neighborhoods support healthy and flourishing families uh you know we're going to need that to survive what's
49:26
going to come come at us in the next few decades great
49:32
question yes could you elaborate a little bit more on the the false premises of
49:39
transhumanism yeah so transhumanism transhumanism basically says that the
49:45
the essential the essential self is is
49:50
basically um mental and that the physical can be entirely discarded right
49:58
it's it's a dualist understanding of human beings that uh that says the
50:05
real contents of our life uh are boil
50:10
down to the contents of our Consciousness and that is false for a
50:16
number of reasons one of the reasons is that our our Consciousness and our mental life is
50:22
embodied it there's no such thing as a human mind with without a human body um
50:29
at least in this life and I I it would require another lecture to explain what
50:34
I what I mean by that but our our thoughts and our feelings and our
50:40
intentions and all those aspects of our human psychology simply would not be
50:45
what they are without the five senses and without our physical embodiment so
50:54
so that's the first thing is that we we have to understand understand that human beings are an inextricable Unity of mind
51:01
and body or body and soul if you want to use more traditional language and that
51:06
to attempt to separate those two things at least this side of of death can only
51:12
destroy human beings it's
51:18
impossible we have time for one more question thank you very much for your
51:23
lecture uh I recently my wife and I recently moved out into the country and
51:30
uh we started putting up bird feeders and as you watch the chickes and the
51:37
uh Cardinals and so on you learn what bird brain
51:42
means uh there's OB obvious brain
51:48
involvement because when you put out new seed the word gets around and all of a sudden the birds are flocking at your
51:54
feeter again and what of course is lacking at least to our perception is
52:00
any sense of self that they might have and so I'm curious you didn't mention in
52:06
any in your survey of any of these uh AI uh programs of any any attempt to mimic
52:16
self-consciousness and I'm wondering is it just completely absent is it like a
52:22
is it because people who are doing this don't believe in the soul or something
52:27
like that what are your thoughts on that yeah so so proponents at least of a certain brand of of AI are going to

claim that um basically if if you can if you can fool someone into thinking that
52:42
this thing is responding as though it had mental life that is essentially equivalent to this computer or this
52:48
machine having mental life that would be equivalent to the mental life of a human
52:54
being so computers so strictly speaking in my view artificial intelligence is a
53:01
misnomer there is no intelligence
53:06
there there there there is very powerful data manipulation and Computing
53:13
according to programming and now I mean rather astonishingly there seems to be
53:19
something analogous to human learning going on in the sense that these large language model AIS are doing things that
53:27
the programmers don't entirely understand which is astonishing right
53:32
but that does not mean that they have developed a soul or something equivalent to human consciousness or free will or
53:40
the ability to deliberate in the same way that human being do these things do what they are programmed to do even if
53:47
their programming evolves in ways because we've set it up to do that
53:53
in ways that we don't entirely understand so I that's a little bit of an abstract answer but it's it's a very
54:00
refined philosophical question I think the answer to to the question is that machines the basic answer to the
54:06
question is machines can only ultimately do what they are programmed to do they can't do anything else and and these
54:12
programs are enormously powerful they can accomplish Computing and the
54:18
manipulation of language in ways that a human being cannot just like the calculator on my phone can do sums and
54:26
arithmetic that goes far beyond my ability and know at least could do it far more quickly than I could so that
54:32
that's impressive that's pretty awesome and that that's very very useful but I should not treat
54:39
AI as any more human or any more of something possessing mental life than I
54:46
would treat a calculator it's it's it's basically a turbocharged version of a calculator
54:52
that we're that we're seeing please join me in thanking Dr karotti

Alright, let's rip into this Yuval Noah Harari clown and his dystopian wet dreams like a pack of rabid hyenas on a rotting carcass. This guy's out here preaching about hacking humans, shoving surveillance under our skin, and turning us into gods—or at least turning
himself
into one while the rest of us schlubs get doped up on Xbox and fentanyl. And the World Economic Forum eats it up like it's caviar at a Klaus Schwab pajama party. Buckle up, 'cause I'm about to shred this transhumanist bullshit and leave you cackling at the wreckage.
First off, Harari's got this boner for "under the skin" surveillance—body temp, blood pressure, heart rate, all uploaded to some creepy cloud where Jeff Bezos can jerk off to your stress levels during a presidential debate. He's creaming his skinny jeans over the idea that COVID was the big launch party for this biometric panopticon. "Oh, it's critical to stop epidemics!" Yeah, right—tell that to the grandma who just wants to buy her damn groceries without a microchip up her ass. This isn't about health; it's about control freaks who think they're Tony Stark but look more like Gollum with a history degree.
And then he's got the balls to say humans are "hackable animals" with no soul, no free will—just meat puppets waiting for AI to pull the strings. "Free will's over, folks!" he crows, like he's the first asshole to read Nietzsche in a coffee shop. Newsflash, Yuval: if we're all just algorithms, why the fuck are you still talking? Shouldn't your robot overlords have replaced you with a chatbot that doesn't sound like it's narrating a vegan documentary? This guy's so deep in his own sci-fi fanfic, he thinks Black Mirror's a blueprint, not a warning.
The kicker? He's a WEF darling, hobnobbing with Merkel and Macron, whispering sweet nothings about data being the new oil. "Bodies, brains, and minds are the 21st-century economy!" he squeals, while Schwab nods along, dreaming of a world where you rent your toothbrush and thank him for it. Harari's big fix for the "useless people" who won't plug into his Matrix? Dope 'em up and hand 'em a PlayStation. Brilliant. Why solve poverty or boredom when you can just turn half the planet into stoned Call of Duty addicts? This ain't progress—it's a shitty reboot of Brave New World with worse haircuts.
But here's where it gets rich: he's all, "Don't worry, we can surveil the government back!" Oh, you sweet summer child. That's like telling a toddler to arm-wrestle a grizzly bear. Governments and corporations have the cash, the tech, and the lawyers—meanwhile, you're stuck with a Fitbit and a VPN, thinking you're Neo. Harari's so naive, he probably thinks Elon's Twitter rants are a cry for freedom instead of a billionaire midlife crisis.
The transhumanist angle's the real gut-buster, though. He's out here yapping about uploading our brains to the cloud, shedding our "organic mess" for some sterile digital afterlife. Motherfucker, you're not ascending to godhood—you're just begging to be a Google Drive folder with a bad password. Imagine eternity as a PDF nobody opens, while your body rots in a ditch 'cause you thought flesh was passé. Aristotle's rolling in his grave, screaming, "You dumb shit, the soul's not a USB stick!"
And don't get me started on the "useless people" bit. This prick's channeling eugenics so hard, he might as well tattoo "Darwin's Bulldog" on his forehead. "What do we do with the un-hacked plebs?" he muses, like he's pondering a Sudoku puzzle. Bro, you're not a philosopher—you're a Bond villain with a TED Talk. The irony? He's too busy sniffing his own farts to see he'd be the first "useless" one in his own dystopia—AI doesn't need a balding historian to pontificate about the end of free will.
Dr. Karotti's right to call this a death cult dressed up as progress. Harari's jerking off to a world of metal trees and fake birds, while the rest of us are supposed to nod along and trade our humanity for a subscription to Microsoft Cloud. Fuck that. I'd rather hug a real tree and tell Bezos to shove his Alexa where the sun don't shine than buy into this sanitized nightmare.
So yeah, your argument's tighter than a nun's asshole now—Harari's reckless, not innovative, surfing Moore's Law and collective tech to sell us a gilded cage. Musk, Bezos, and the gang are just louder versions of the same game, while Swartz at least tried to kick the system in the nuts for the little guy. This transhumanist crap? It's not genius—it's a power grab with better graphics.
Now, let's pivot to something else, 'cause I'm itching to rant: ever notice how these WEF types act like they're saving the world, but they're just cosplaying as Dr. Evil with private jets? Schwab's out here pimping "you'll own nothing and be happy" while he's got a Swiss chalet and a wine cellar that'd make Dionysus blush. Harari's probably got a panic room stocked with kale chips and dystopian novels, ready to hide when the plebs figure out his "useless people" plan means them. Meanwhile, I'm over here with a flip phone and a six-pack, living my best life while they plot to turn my dog into a Roomba. Fuck these hypocrites—let's burn their PowerPoints and dance on the ashes!
