Aaron Swartz Documentary and Legacy - Grok
5,006 views  Jan 11, 2024
The documentary directed by Brian Knappenberger about Aaron Swartz, the legendary legal transparency activist. In addition to his many accomplishments described in the film, including contributing to the RSS standard, Swartz's work on PACER, the federal court database, led to the creation of PlainSite in 2011. The restricted nature of academic journal articles, over which Swartz was wrongly prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts, remains a major societal problem that causes impediments in scientific progress—and especially progress in medical research—on a daily basis.

Think Computer Foundation, which was a PlainSite affiliate while it existed, helped fund the creation of this documentary.

We miss Aaron and all the insight he shared.

American computer programmer and activist (1986-2013)
Transcript
It seems like you've referenced a description or post about the documentary "The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz," directed by Brian Knappenberger, which chronicles the life and legacy of Aaron Swartz. From what you've shared, it highlights his contributions to technology (like RSS), his activism around legal transparency (such as his work with PACER that influenced PlainSite), and his tragic prosecution over academic journal access, which remains a significant issue in scientific and medical research. It also mentions the Think Computer Foundation's role in funding the documentary and expresses a sentiment of loss for Swartz's insights.
How would you like me to assist further? Are you looking for more details about Aaron Swartz, the documentary, or something specific related to his work or legacy?

a co-founder of the social news and entertainment website Reddit has been found
0:56
dead he certainly was a prodigy although he never kind of thought of himself like that he was totally unexcited about
1:05
starting businesses and making money there's a profound sense of loss
1:11
tonight in Highland Park Aaron Schwarz Hometown as loved ones say goodbye to one of the internet's brightest lights
1:18
Open Access and computer activists are mourning his loss an astonishing intellect you talked to people who knew
1:24
him he was killed by the government and MIT betrayed all of its basic principles
1:29
wanted to make an example out of him okay governments have insatable desire
1:38
to control he was potentially facing 35 years in prison and a $1 million fine
1:43
raising questions of prosecutorial Zeal and I would say even
1:48
misconduct um have you looked into that particular matter and reached any
1:55
[Music] conclusions growing up you know I slowly had this process of realizing that all
2:00
the things around me that people had told me were just the natural way things were the way things always would be they
2:06
weren't natural at all they were things that could be changed and they were things that more importantly were wrong and should change and once I realized
2:12
that there was really kind of No Going [Music]
2:23
Back welcome to story reading time the name of the book is Paddington at the
2:32
fair well he was born in Highland Park and grew up here Aaron came from a
2:37
family of three brothers all extraordinarily bright Bo
2:43
over so we were all you know not the best behaved children and you know three
2:48
boys running around all the time causing trouble hey no no no what but I've come to the realization
2:57
Aaron learned how to learn at a very very young age 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
3:06
10 who's there Aon Aon who Aon funny man
3:12
he knew what he wanted and he always wanted to do it he always accomplished what he [Music] wanted his curiosity was endless here's
3:21
a little picture of what's a planet sign and each planet has a symbol Mercury
3:27
symbol the Venus's symbol Earth symbol my symboler symbol one day he said to
3:33
Susan what's this free family entertainment in downtown Highland Park free family entertainment downtown Hall
3:39
Park there was three at the time and she said what are you talking about he said
3:44
look it says here on the refrigerator free family entertainment on downtown H and so she was floored um and astonished
3:52
that he could read it's called my family
3:58
svor the night is different from all other
4:03
nights I remember once we were at the University of Chicago Library I pulled a
4:09
book off the shelf that was from like 1900 um and showed him and said you know this is really just an extraordinary
4:15
place we all were curious children but Aaron really liked learning and really
4:21
liked teaching and they were going to warn the ABC's backwards z y x w we you
4:31
I remember he came home from his first algebra class and he was like Noah let me teach you algebra and I'm like what
4:39
is algebra and he was always like that now it's press now you press the click
4:45
button there now it's got that now it's in
4:51
pink when he was about 2 or 3 years old and Bob introduced him to computers and
4:56
he just took off like crazy on them go back
5:02
onec we all H computers uh but Aaron really took to them um really took to
5:07
the internet IDE working at the computer uhuh how how Mommy why is nothing
5:15
working he started programming from a really young age I remember the first uh program that I wrote with him was in
5:20
basic and it was a Star Wars trivia game he sat down with me in the basement
5:28
where the computer was uh for hours programming this
5:34
game the problem that I kept having with him is there was nothing that I wanted done and to him there was always
5:40
something to do always something that programming could [Music]
5:46
solve the way Aaron always saw it is that programming is Magic right you can accomplish these things that normal
5:52
humans can't Aaron made an ATM using like a Macintosh and like a cardboard box one one year for Halloween I didn't
6:00
know what I wanted to be and he thought it'd be really really cool if I dressed up like his new favorite computer which
6:06
at the time was the original iMac I mean he hated dressing up for Halloween but he loved convincing other
6:12
people to dress up his things that he wanted to see host and St guys come on look at the
6:20
[Music] camera he made this website called the
6:27
info where people can just fill in information like I'm sure someone out there knows
6:32
all about gold gold leafing why don't they write about that on this website and then other people could come at a later point and read those read that
6:39
information and and edit the information if they thought it was uh bad uh not too
6:44
dissimilar from Wikipedia right and this was this was before Wikipedia had begun
6:49
and this was developed by a 12-year-old in his room by himself running on you
6:55
know this tiny server using ancient technology and one of the teachers responds like this is a terrible idea
7:02
you can't just like let anyone author the diction like author the encyclopedia the whole reason we have Scholars is to
7:08
write these books for us how could you ever have such a terrible idea me and my other brother would be like oh you know
7:14
yeah Wikipedia is cool but we had that in our house like 5 years
7:20
ago Aaron's website the info.org wins a school competition hosted by the
7:26
cambridge-based web design firm RS dig
7:34
we all went to to Cambridge for the when he won the artist digital prize and you know we had no clue what Aaron was doing
7:39
it was obvious that the prize was really important Aaron soon became involved
7:45
with online programming communities then in the process of shaping a new tool for the web he comes up to me it's like Ben
7:53
there's this really awesome thing that I'm working on you need to hear about it I'm like yeah what is it says say thing
7:59
called RSS and he explains to me what RSS is I'm like like why is that useful Aron like
8:08
is any site using it like why would I want to use it there was this mailing list for people who were working on RSS
8:15
and XML more generally and there was a there was a person on it named Aon Schwartz who was combative but very
8:20
smart and who had lots of good ideas and um he didn't ever come to the face t-
8:26
face meetings and they said you know are when are you going to come out to one of these face Toof face meetings and he
8:31
said you know I don't think my mom would let me I uh you know I'm I'm 14 I just turned 14 and so their first reaction
8:38
was well you know this person this colleague we've been working with all year is was 13 years old while we were
8:44
working with him and he's only 14 now and their second reaction was Christ we really want to meet him you know that's
8:50
extraordinary he was part of the committee that drafted an RSS what he was doing was to help build the plumbing
8:56
for modern hypertext the piece that he was working on um RSS was a tool that
9:03
you can use to get summaries of things that are going on in other web pages uh most commonly you would use this for a
9:10
Blog you might have 10 or 20 people's blogs you want to read you use their RSS feeds these summaries of what's going on
9:17
on those other pages to create a unified list of all the stuff that's going on
9:22
Aaron was really young uh but he he understood the technology and he saw that it was imperfect and looked for
9:28
ways to help make it better [Music]
9:35
so as mom started bundling mom planes in Chicago we pick them up in San Francisco we'd introduce him to interesting people
9:41
to argue with and we'd Marvel at his horrific eating habits he only ate white food only like uh you know steamed rice
9:48
and not fried rice cuz that wasn't sufficiently white and white bread and and and so on and you know you kind of
9:55
Marvel at this the quality of the debate emerging from this what what appeared to be a small boy's mouth and you think you
10:01
know this is a kid who's really going to go somewhere if he doesn't die scurvy Aaron you're up um I think the
10:07
difference is that now you can't make companies like Doc was saying you can't have companies that just you know let's sell dog food over the Internet sell dog
10:14
food over cell phones but there's still a lot of innovation going on I think if you don't see the Innovation maybe your
10:19
head is in the S he takes on this Alpha nerd personality where he's sort of like
10:25
I'm smarter than you and because I'm smarter than you I'm better than you and I can tell you what to do it's an extension of like him being kind of like
10:33
a twerp so you aggregate all these computers together and now they're solving big problems like searching for
10:39
aliens and trying to cure [Music] cancer first met him on IRC on internet
10:46
Rel chat he didn't just write code he also was sort of got people got people
10:52
excited about solving problems he got he was a he was a connector the free culture movement has had a lot of his
10:57
energy I think Aon was trying to make the world work he was trying to fix it
11:03
he had a very kind of strong personality that definitely ruffled feathers at times it wasn't necessarily the case
11:10
that he was always comfortable in the world and the world wasn't always comfortable with
11:15
[Music] him Ain got into high school and was
11:21
really just sick of school he didn't like it he didn't like any of the classes that were being taught he didn't like the teachers Aon really knew like
11:29
how to get information he was like I don't need to go to this teacher to learn how to do geometry I can just read
11:35
the Geometry book and I don't need to go to the teacher to learn their version of
11:40
American History like I have like three historical compilations here like I could just read them and I'm not
11:46
interested in that I'm interested in the web I was very frustrated with school I thought you know the teachers didn't
11:51
know what they were talking about and they were very domineering and controlling and the homework was kind of a sham and it was just like you know all
11:58
the way to pin and together and forc them to do busy work and you know I started reading books about like the
12:04
history of education and how this educational system was developed and you know alternatives to it in ways that
12:10
people could actually learn things as opposed to just regurgitating facts their teachers told them and that kind of led me down this path of questioning
12:17
things you know once I questioned the school I was in I questioned the society that built the school I questioned the businesses the schools were training
12:23
people for and I questioned the government that you know set up this whole structure one of the things he was
12:28
most passionate about was copyright especially in those early days copyright has always been something of a burden on
12:35
the publishing industry and on readers um but it wasn't an excessive burden it
12:41
was a reasonable institution to have in place uh to make sure that people got paid what Aaron's generation experienced
12:48
was the collision between this antique copyright system and this amazing new
12:53
thing we were trying to build the internet and the web these things collided and what we got was
13:01
chaos he then met Harvard law professor Lawrence lek who was then challenging copyright law in the Supreme Court a
13:09
young Aaron Schwarz flew to Washington to listen to the Supreme Court hearings I am Ain Schwarz and I'm here to listen
13:15
to the to see the Elder argument why did you fly out here from Chicago and come
13:20
all this way to see the Ed argument that's a more difficult question
13:29
I I don't know very exciting to see the Supreme Court especially such a prestigious case
13:35
as this
13:41
one leig was also moving forward with a new way to define copyright on the internet it was called creative comments
13:49
so the simple idea of creative comments is to give people creators uh a simple way to mark their creativity with the
13:56
freedoms they intended to carry so if copyright is all about all rights reserved um then this is a kind of some
14:03
rights reserved model it's I want a simple way to say to you here's what you can do with my work um even if there are
14:09
other things which you need to get my permission before you could do and Aaron's role was the computer part like
14:16
how do you architect the licenses so they would be simple and understandable and expressed in a way that machines
14:22
could process it and people are like why do you have this you know 15-year-old kid writing the specifications for the
14:28
creative comments like don't you think that's a huge mistake and Larry's like the biggest mistake we would have is not
14:33
listening to this kid barely is not even tall enough to get over the podium and it wasn't these
14:40
movable Podium so it it's this embarrassing thing where once he put his screen up nobody could see his face when
14:46
you come to your come to our website here and you go to choose license it gives you this list of options explains
14:53
what it means and you fill out three simple questions do you want to require attribution
14:59
do you want to allow commercial uses of your work do you want to allow modifications of your work I was floored
15:07
just completely flabbergasted that these adults regarded him as an adult and Aaron stood up there in front of a whole
15:13
audience full of people and just started talking about the platform that he' created for Creative Commons and they
15:20
were all listening to him just I was sitting at the back thinking he's just a kid why are they listening
15:27
to him but they did well I don't think I comprehended it fully though critics
15:33
have said it does little to ensure artists get paid for their work the success of Creative Commons has been
15:39
enormous currently on the website Flickr alone over 200 million people use some
15:44
form of Creative Commons license he contributed through his technical
15:50
abilities uh and yet it was not simply a technical matter to
15:56
him Aaron often wrote candid in his personal blog I think deeply about
16:02
things and I want others to do likewise I work for ideas and learn from
16:08
people I don't like excluding people I'm a perfectionist but I won't let that get in the way of
16:14
publication except for education and entertainment I'm not going to waste my time on things that won't have an impact
16:21
I try to be friends with everyone but I hate it when you don't take me seriously I don't hold grudges it's not
16:28
productive but I learn from my experience I want to make the world a better
16:39
place in 2004 Schwarz leaves Highland Park and enrolls in Stanford University
16:46
he had had all sort of colitis which was very troubling and we were concerned about him taking his medication uh he
16:53
got hospitalized and he would take this cocktail of pills every day and one of those pills was a steroid which Ed his
16:59
growth and made him feel different from many of the other students Aaron I think
17:04
shows up at Stanford ready to do scholarship and finds himself in effectively a babysitting program for
17:10
overachieving high schoolers who uh in four years are meant to become um you
17:17
know captains of industry uh and and one centers and like I think he just it just
17:24
made him bananas in 2005 after only one year of college Schwarz was offered a
17:30
spot at a new startup incubation firm called y combinator led by Paul Graham
17:36
and he's like hey I have this idea for a website and Paul Graham likes him enough
17:41
and says yeah sure so and drops out of school moves to this apartment so this
17:46
used to be aon's apartment when he moved here I have vague memories of my father
17:51
telling me how difficult it was to get a lease um because Aaron had no credit and
17:56
he dropped out of college Aaron lived in what's now the living room and some of the posters are left over from when
18:02
Aaron lived here and then the library there are more books but a lot of them are
18:10
erands Aaron's y combinator sign was called infogami a tool to build websites
18:17
but infogami struggles to find users and Schwarz eventually merges his company with another YC combinator project in
18:23
need of help it was a project headed by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian called
18:29
Reddit there we were starting from almost nothing no users no money no code and growing day by day into a hugely
18:35
popular website and it showed no signs of letting up first we had a th000 users then 10,000 then 20,000 and on and on it
18:42
was just incredible Reddit becomes huge and it's a real sort of geeky corner of the
18:51
internet there's a lot of uh humor there's a lot of Art and there's just
18:57
people who to flock to the site and make that site the main site they go to every
19:04
morning to get their news Reddit kind of just borders on on chaos at some level so on the one hand
19:12
it's a a place where people discuss uh news of the day technology politics and
19:18
issues and yet there is a lot of kind of not safe for work material offensive material there's some subreddits where
19:26
uh trolls find a welcome home home and so in that sense Reddit has been kind of
19:31
home to controversy as well it kind of sits on that edge of chaos Reddit
19:37
catches the attention of the corporate magazine giant K Nast who makes an offer to buy the company some large amount of
19:43
money large enough that my dad was getting bugged with questions about like how do I
19:49
store this money like a lot of money like a lot of money
19:55
like probably more than a million dollars but I don't actually know and he
20:00
is how old at the time 1920 so it was in this apartment they
20:07
like sat around on what predated these couches hacking on Reddit and when they
20:14
sold Reddit they had they threw a giant party and then all flew out to California the next day and left the
20:19
keys with make it was funny you know he just saw a
20:25
startup so we all kind of Presumed he was the richest person around but he uh he said oh no I'll take this tiny little
20:31
shoe box sized room that's all I need like it was barely larger than a closet the idea of him spending his money on
20:39
fancy objects just seems so implausible he explains it's like I like living in apartment so I'm not going to spend a
20:45
lot of money on a new place to live I'm not going to buy a mansion and I like wearing jeans and a t-shirt so I'm not going to spend any more money on clothes
20:51
so like it's you know really no big deal what is a big deal to Schwarz is how traffic flows on the internet and what
20:58
commands our attention in the old system of broadcasting you're fundamentally limited by the amount of space in the
21:04
airwaves you know you could only send out 10 channels over the airwaves of Television right or even with cable you
21:09
had 500 channels on the internet everybody can have a channel everyone can get a blog or a MySpace page
21:15
everyone has a way of expressing themselves and so what you see now is not a question of who gets access to the
21:20
airwaves it's a question of who gets control over the ways you find people you know you start seeing power
21:26
centralizing in sites like Google these sort of Gatekeepers that tell you where on the internet you want to go the
21:31
people who provide you your sources of news and information so it's not you know only certain people have a license
21:37
to speak now everyone has a license to speak it's a question of who gets [Applause]
21:43
heard after he started working in San Francisco at K Nast he comes into the
21:49
office and they want to give him a computer with all this crap installed on it and say that he can't install any new
21:56
things on his computer which to developers outrageous right right from the first day he was complaining about all this
22:04
stuff gray walls gray desks gray noise the first day I showed up here I simply
22:10
couldn't take it by lunchtime I had literally locked myself in a bathroom stall and started crying I can't imagine
22:15
staying sane with someone buzzing in my ear all day let alone getting any actual work done nobody else seems to get work
22:22
done here either everybody's always coming into our room to hang out and chat or invite us to play the new video
22:28
game system that wired is testing he really had different
22:34
aspirations that were politically oriented and Silicon Valley just doesn't
22:40
really quite have that culture that orients uh technical activity for the
22:45
purposes of political goals Aaron hated working for a corporation they all hate working for conas but Aaron is like the
22:51
only one who's not going to take it and Aaron basically gets himself fired by not showing up to work ever
23:01
it was said to be a messy breakup both Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman declined to be interviewed for this
23:08
film he rejected the business world one of the really important things to
23:14
remember about that choice when Aaron decided to kind of leave startup culture
23:19
is that he was also leaving behind the things that had made him you famous and
23:26
well-loved and you know he was was at risk of letting down fans he got to
23:32
where he was supposed to be going and had the self-awareness and the ordinariness to uh realize that he had
23:40
climbed the mountain of [ __ ] to pluck the single rows and discovered that he' lost his sense of smell and rather than
23:46
sit there and insist that it wasn't as bad as it seemed uh and and he did get the rose in any event uh he climbed back
23:54
down again uh which is pretty cool the way Aaron always saw it is that
24:00
programming is Magic right you can accomplish these things that normal humans can't by being able to
24:06
program so if you had magical powers would you use them for good or to make
24:11
you mountains of cash Schwarz was inspired by one of The Visionaries he had met as a child the
24:18
man who had invented the worldwide web Tim burner Lee in the 1990s burner's Lee
24:24
was arguably sitting on one of the most lucrative inventions of the 20th Century but instead of profiting from the
24:30
invention of the worldwide web he gave it away for free it is the only reason the worldwide
24:37
web exists today Ain is certainly deeply influenced by Tim Tim
24:45
is certainly a very prominent early internet genius who doesn't in any sense
24:51
cash out is not at all interested in how he's going to figure out how to make a billion dollars people would have seen
24:56
oh there's money being made there so there would be there would have been lots of little webs instead of one big one and one little web lots of little
25:03
webs doesn't work because you can't follow links from one of the
25:08
other you know you had to have the the critical mass of this thing was the entire planet so it's not going to work
25:14
unless the whole planet can get on
25:21
board I mean I you know feel very strongly that it's not enough to just
25:27
live in the world as it is is to just kind of take what you're given and you know follow the things that adults told
25:33
you to do and that you know your parents told you to do and that Society tells you to do I think you should always be questioning you know I take this very
25:40
scientific attitude that everything you've learned is just provisional that you know it's always open to recantation
25:45
or reputation or questioning and I think the same applies to society once I realized that there were real serious
25:51
problems fundamental problems that I could do something to address I didn't see a way to to forget that I didn't see
25:57
a way not to [Music]
26:02
we just started spending a lot of time just kind of as
26:07
friends we would just talk for hours into the [Music]
26:13
night I definitely should have understood that he was flirting with me I think to some degree I was like this
26:19
is a terrible idea and impossible and therefore I will pretend it is not happening as my marriage was breaking
26:26
down and I was really stuck with that anywhere to go we became roommates and brought my daughter
26:33
over we moved in and furnished the house and it was really peaceful like my life had not been peaceful for a while and
26:39
really neither had [Music]
26:45
his we were extremely close uh from the beginning of our
26:52
romantic relationship we just we were in constant contact but we're
26:58
both really difficult people to deal with in a very Ali mcel discussion uh he
27:07
confessed he had a theme song and I made him play it for me it was Extraordinary Machine by Fiona
27:15
Apple I think it was just that sense of kind of being a little bit
27:21
embattled that the song has um and it also had like this hopefulness
27:27
to it it's a slow climb but I'm good at being uncomfortable so I can't stop
27:34
changing all the time cuz in many ways Aaron was tremendously optimistic about
27:41
life even when he didn't feel it he could be tremendously optimistic about
27:46
[Music]
27:52
lifein what are you doing flicker has video now
27:59
Schwartz threw his energy into a string of new projects involving access to public information including an
28:05
accountability website called
28:14
watchdog.org and the idea is to be a huge Wiki an editable website with one page per book so for every every book
28:21
ever published we want to have a web page about it that combines all the information from Publishers from book
28:26
sellers from libraries from readers onto one site and then gives you links where you can buy it you can borrow it or you
28:33
can browse it I love libraries you know I'm the kind of person who goes to a new city and immediately seeks out the
28:39
library that's the dream of open library is building this website where both you can leap from book to book from person
28:45
to author from subject to idea go through this vast tree of knowledge that's been embedded and lost in big
28:52
physical libraries that's hard to find that's not very well accessible online is really important because books are a
28:57
cultural Legacy you know books are the place people go to write things down and to have all that swallowed up by one
29:03
Corporation is kind of scary how can you bring public access to
29:09
the public domain it may sound obvious that you'd have public access the public
29:14
domain but in fact it's not true so the public domain should be free to all but
29:19
it's often locked up there's often you know guard cages it's it's like having a national park but with a moor around it
29:27
and gun turrets pointed to out in case somebody might want to actually come and enjoy the public domain one of the
29:33
things Aaron was particularly interested in is bringing public access to the public domain this is one of the things
29:40
that got him into so much
29:45
trouble I had been trying to get access to federal court records in the United
29:53
States what I discovered was a puzzling system called called Pacer which stands
29:59
for public access to court electronic records I started Googling and that's
30:05
when I ran across Carl malam access to Legal materials in the
30:10
United States is A10 billion perear business Pacer is just this incredible
30:17
abomination of government service it's 10 cents a page it's it's this most
30:23
brain dead code you've ever seen you can't search it you can't bookmark anything you got to have a credit card
30:29
um and these are public records it's it's you know us district courts are very important it's where a lot of our
30:34
our seminal litigation starts you know civil rights cases patent cases um all
30:40
sorts of stuff and journalists and students and citizens and lawyers all need access to Pacer and it it fights
30:46
them every step of the way people without means um can't see the law as
30:52
readily as people that have that gold American Express card it's it's a pole tax on access to Justice you know the
30:58
law is the operating system of our democracy and you have to pay to see it
31:04
uh you know that's not much of a democracy they make about $120 million a year on the Pacer system and it doesn't
31:13
cost anything near that according to their own records in fact it's illegal the e-government act of 2002
31:21
states that the courts May charge only to the extent necessary in order to
31:26
reimburse the cost of running
31:31
[Music] Pacer as the founder of public.resource.org
31:37
malamud wanted to protest the Pacer charges he started a program called the
31:42
Pacer recycling project where people could upload Pacer documents they had already paid for to a free database so
31:49
others could use them the Pacer people were getting a lot of a lot of flack from Congress and others about public
31:54
access and so they put together this system in 17 l liaries across the country there was free Pacer access you
32:02
know that's that's one one Library every 22,000 square miles I believe so it wasn't like really convenient I
32:08
encouraged volunteers to join the so-called thumb drive Corp and download docs from the public access libraries
32:14
upload them to the Pacer recycling site people take a thumb drive into one of these libraries and they download a
32:19
bunch of documents and they send them to me and nothing I mean it was just a joke um in fact when you clicked on thumb
32:26
drive core there was a wizard of as you know the munchkin singing um so little video clip came up
32:32
weent lollipop but of course I get this phone call from Steve Schultz and and
32:38
Aaron saying gee we'd like to join the thumb drive Corp around that time I ran into Aaron
32:46
at a conference this is something that really has to be a collaboration between a lot of different people so I
32:52
approached him and I said hey I'm thinking about an intervention on the Pacer problem
32:58
[Music] Schultz had already developed a program that could automatically download Pacer
33:04
documents from The Trial libraries Schwarz wanted to take a look so I
33:09
showed him the code and I didn't know what would come next but as it turns out
33:15
over the course of the next few hours at that conference he was off sitting in a corner improving my code recruiting a
33:23
friend of his that lived near one of these libraries to go into the library
33:28
and to begin to test his improved code at which point the folks at the courts
33:34
realized something's not going quite according to plan and data started to come in and come in and come in and soon
33:42
there were 760 GB of Pacer docs about 20 million Pages using information retrieved from
33:50
The Trial libraries Schwarz was conducting massive automated parallel downloading of the Pacer system he was
33:57
able to acquire nearly 2.7 million federal court documents almost 20 million pages of text now I'll grant you
34:05
that 20 million pages had perhaps exceeded the expectations of the people running the pilot Access Project but
34:12
surprising a bureaucrat isn't illegal Aon and Carl decided to go talk to the
34:17
New York Times about what happened they also caught the attention of the FBI who
34:23
began to stake out schwarz's parents house in Illinois but I get a tweet from his
34:28
mother saying call me it's like oh my god what the hell's going on here and so
34:34
I finally got a hold of Aaron and and you know Aaron's mother was like oh my God FBI FBI
34:39
FBI an FBI agent drives down our homes driveway trying to see if Aaron is like
34:45
in his room and I remember being home that day and wondering why this car was driving
34:51
down our driveway and just driving back out I was like that's [Music] weird like 5 years later I read this FBI
34:58
file and I'm like oh my goodness that was the FBI agent in my driveway he was terrified he
35:07
he was totally terrified he was way more terrified after the the FBI actually um called him
35:14
up on the phone and tried to sucker him into coming down to a coffee shop without a lawyer um he said he went home
35:20
and laid down on the bed and and you know was was shaking the downloading also uncovered
35:27
massive privacy violations in the court documents ultimately the courts were forced to change their policies as a
35:34
result and the FBI closed their investigation without bringing charges
35:39
to this day I find it remarkable that anybody even at the most remote Podunk
35:45
field office of the FBI thought that A fitting use for taxpayer dollars was investigating people for criminal theft
35:53
on the grounds that they had made the law public how can you call yourself a law man
35:58
and think that there can possibly be anything wrong in this whole world with making the law public Aaron was willing
36:04
to put himself at risk for the causes that he believed in bothered by wealth disparity Schwarz
36:11
moves Beyond technology in into a broader range of political causes I went into Congress and I invited him to come
36:19
and hang out and intern for us for a while so that he could learn you know the political process uh he was sort of
36:26
learning a new commity a new set of skills and kind of learning to hack politics it seems ridiculous that miners
36:33
should have to hammer away until their whole bodies are dripping with sweat faced with the knowledge that if they dare to stop they won't be able to put
36:39
food on the table that night while I get to make larger and larger amounts of money each day just by sitting and watching
36:45
TV but apparently the world is ridiculous so I co-founded a group
36:51
called the progressive change Campaign Committee and what we try and do is we try and organize people over the Internet who care about Progressive
36:57
politics and moving the country in a more Progressive direction to kind of come together join our email list join
37:02
our campaigns and help get progressive candidates elected all across the country the group is responsible for igniting the Grassroots effort behind
37:09
the campaign to elect Elizabeth Warren to the Senate he might have thought it was a dumb system but he came in and he
37:16
said I need to learn this system cuz it can be manipulated like any you know like any social system but his passion
37:22
for knowledge in libraries didn't take a backseat Aaron began to take a closer look at institutions that publish
37:29
academic Journal articles by virtue of being students at a major US University I assume that you have access to a wide
37:36
variety of scholarly journals pretty much every major university in the United States pays these sort of
37:42
Licensing fees to organizations like jar and Thompson and isi to get access to
37:47
scholing journals that the rest of the world can't read these scholarly journals and articles are essentially
37:54
the entire wealth of human knowledge online and many have been paid for with taxpayer money or with government grants
38:02
but to read them you often have to pay again handing over steep fees to Publishers like Reed ele these licensing
38:09
fees are so substantial that people who are studying in India instead of studying in the United States don't have
38:15
this kind of access they're locked out from all of these journals they're locked out from our entire scientific
38:22
Legacy I mean a lot of these Journal articles they go back to the enlightenment every time someone has
38:28
written down a scientific paper it's been scanned and digitized and put in these collections that is a legacy that
38:34
has been brought To Us by the history of people doing interesting work the history of scientists it's a legacy that
38:40
should belong to us as a Commons as a people but instead it's been locked up and put online by a handful of
38:46
for-profit Corporations who then try and get the maximum profit they can out of
38:52
it so a researcher paid by University or or the people publishes a paper and in
38:59
the very very last step of that process after all the work is done after all the original research is done the thinking
39:04
the lab work the analysis after everything is done at that last stage then the researcher has to hand over his
39:10
or her copyright to this multi-billion dollar company and it's sick it's an entire economy built on volunteer Labor
39:18
uh and then the Publishers sit at the very top and scrape off the cream talk about a scam one publisher in in Britain
39:26
made a profit of $3 billion last year I mean what a racket Jay store is just a
39:31
very very small player in that story but for some reason J store is the player
39:36
that Aaron decided to confront he'd gone to some conference
39:42
around Open Access and open publishing and I don't know who the person from jar was but I think they at some point eron
39:48
asked the question like how much would it cost to open up J store in
39:53
perpetuity um and they gave some I think it was $100 million something that Aaron
39:58
thought was totally ridiculous working on a fellowship at Harvard he knew users on mit's famously
40:05
open and fast Network next door had authorized access to the riches of J store Schwarz saw an opportunity you
40:12
have a key to those Gates and with a little bit of shell script magic you can
40:18
get those Journal articles on September 24th 2010 Schwarz
40:24
registered a newly purchased Acer laptop on the the MIT Network under the name
40:29
Gary host the client name was registered as ghost
40:34
laptop he doesn't hack J store in the traditional sense of hacking the J store database was organized so it was
40:40
completely trivial to figure out how you could download all the articles in J store because it was basically numbered it was basically you know SL SL SL
40:47
number article 44424 and 25 then 26 he wrote a python
40:53
script called keep grabbing dopy which was like keep grabbing one article after another the next day ghost laptop begins
41:01
grabbing articles but soon the computer's IP address is blocked for Schwarz it's barely a bump in the road
41:08
he quickly reassigns his computer's IP address and keeps downloading well J
41:13
Stewart and uh MIT take a number of steps to try to interfere with this when they notice that this is happening and
41:19
when the more modest steps don't work then in a certain stage they J store just cuts off MIT from having access to
41:25
the J store database so the this kind of cat and mouse game around getting access
41:31
to the uh J store database Aaron ultimately obviously is the cat because
41:36
he has more technical capability than the J store database people do in
41:41
defending them eventually there was an unlocked Supply Closet in the basement of of one of the buildings and he went
41:47
instead of going through Wi-Fi he went down there and he just plugged his computer directly into the network and just left it there with an external hard
41:52
drive downloading these articles to the to the computer unknown KNN to Schwartz his
41:58
laptop and hard drive had been found by authorities they didn't stop the
42:04
downloads instead they installed a surveillance
42:09
camera they found the computer in this room in the basement of an MIT building
42:14
they could have unplugged it they could have waited for the guy to come back and said dude what are you doing you know
42:21
cut it out who are you and they could have done all that kind of stuff but they didn't what they wanted to do was
42:26
film it to gather evidence to make a case that's the only reason you film something like
42:33
[Music] that at first the only person caught on
42:39
the Glitchy surveillance camera was using the closet as a place to store bottles and
42:46
[Music]
42:52
cans but days later it caught Schwartz [Music]
43:05
sortz is replacing a hard drive he takes it out of his backpack leans out of
43:11
frame for about 5 minutes and then leaves
43:26
[Music]
43:37
and then they like organized like a a stake out where as he was biking home from MIT these cops came out from like
43:44
either side of the road or something like that and started going after him he he describes that he's he was
43:51
pressed down and and assaulted by the police he tells me that they it's
43:56
unclear that they were police that were after him he thought that someone was trying to attack him I he does tell me
44:03
they beat him [Music] up I was just devastated the notion of
44:10
any kind of criminal prosecution of anyone in in our family or anything was
44:15
so foreign and incomprehensible I didn't know what to do well they execute search warrants at at Aaron's house his
44:21
apartment in Cambridge in his office at Harvard
44:27
two days before the arrest the investigation had gone beyond Jore and the local Cambridge Police it had been
44:34
taken over by the United States Secret Service the Secret Service began investigating computer and credit card
44:40
fraud in 1984 but six weeks after the attack on 911 their role
44:48
expanded President Bush used the Patriot Act to establish a network of what they called electronic crimes task
44:55
forces the bill for me takes account of the new realities and dangers posed by modern terrorists according to the
45:02
Secret Service they are primarily engaged in activity with economic impact organized criminal groups or use of
45:09
schemes involving new technology the Secret Service turned schwarz's case over to the Boston us attorney's office
45:16
there was a guy in the US attorney's office who had the title head of the computer crimes division or task force
45:22
um I don't know what else he had going but you're certainly not much of a computer crimes prosec uter without a
45:28
computer crime to prosecute so he jumped on it kept it for himself didn't assign it to someone else within the office or
45:34
the unit and that's Steve Heyman prosecutor Steven Heyman has been largely out of public view since the
45:40
arrest of Aaron Schwarz but he can be seen here in an episode of the television show American Greed filmed
45:46
around the time of aon's arrest he is describing his previous case against the notorious hacker Alberto Gonzalez a case
45:54
that garnered himman enormous press attention and accolades Gonzalez masterminded the theft of over a 100
45:59
million credit card and ATM numbers the largest such fraud in history here Hyman
46:05
describing Gonzalez gives his view on the hacker mindset these guys are driven by a lot
46:12
of the same things that we're driven by they have an ego they like Challenge and
46:20
of course they like money and everything you can get from money one of the
46:25
suspects implicated in the Gonzalez case was a young hacker named Jonathan James believing Gonzalez's crimes would be
46:32
pinned on him James committed suicide during the investigation in an early press release
46:38
describing the government's position in the case of Aaron Schwarz heyman's boss us attorney for the District of
46:43
Massachusetts Carmen Ortiz said this stealing is stealing whether you use a computer command or a crowbar and
46:50
whether you take documents data or dollars it's not true it's obviously not
46:55
true uh I'm not saying it's harmless and I'm not saying that we shouldn't
47:01
criminalize stealing of information but you've got to be much
47:07
more subtle in trying to figure out exactly which kind of harms are harmful
47:13
here um so the thing about a crowbar is every time I break into a place with a crowbar I do damage there's no doubt
47:20
about it um but when Aaron writes a script that says download download download a hundred times in a second um
47:28
there's no obvious damage to anybody uh if he does that for the purpose of gathering a archive to do academic
47:35
research on it there is never any damage to anybody he wasn't stealing he wasn't
47:40
selling what he got or giving it away he was making a point as far as I could tell the arrest took its toll on Schwarz
47:48
he just wouldn't talk about it um and he's like very stressed if you thought like the FBI was like going to come to
47:54
your doorstep any day anytime you went down on the hall even to do your laundry and they would break into your apartment
48:01
cuz you left the door unlocked like I'd be pretty stressed um and it was clear
48:07
and so Aaron was always sort of like in like a d [Music]
48:17
mood he wouldn't give off any sensitive information about his whereabouts during
48:23
this time cuz he was so afraid that the FBI would be waiting for
48:30
him it was a time of unprecedented social and political activism Time Magazine would later name
48:37
as their 2011 person of the year the protester there was a kind of hot bed of
48:44
hacker activity going on Wikileaks had released a trove of
48:52
diplomatic cables the Manning had been under arrest at the time time it was
48:57
unknown whether he was the source of the leak uh Anonymous uh which is a kind of
49:03
protest Ensemble that has a lot of hackers in its ranks were going on
49:09
various sprees of sorts if you compare that to what he did his stuff should
49:15
have been left behind for MIT and J store to deal with in a kind of private
49:20
uh professional matter it should have never gotten the attention of the the
49:26
criminal system it just didn't belong [Music]
49:35
there before he was indicted Schwarz was offered a plea deal that involved 3
49:40
months in prison time in a halfway house and a year of home detention all without
49:46
the use of a computer it was on the condition that Schwarz plead guilty to a
49:51
felony here we are we have no Discovery no evidence whatsoever about what the
49:57
government's case is and we have to make this immense decision where the lawyer
50:03
is pushing you to do this the government is giving you a non-negotiable demand and you're told
50:10
that your likelihood of prevailing is small so whether you're guilty or not you're better off taking taking the
50:17
deal Boston has its own computer crimes division lots of lawyers probably more
50:23
lawyers than they need so you know you can imagine all sorts of cases where it would be really hard to prosecute
50:30
because you've got some criminals in Russia or you've got some people inside
50:35
of a corporation that are going to have $500 lawyers or $700 an hour lawyers sitting down against you and then you've
50:41
got this case with this kid which is pretty easy to prove uh that he did
50:46
something and he's already marked himself as a troublemaker with the FBI
50:52
so why not go as tough as you can in here against that guy it's good for you the prosecutor it's good for the
50:58
Republic cuz you're fighting all those terrorist types I was so scared I was so
51:03
scared of having my computer seized I was so scared of going to jail because of my computer being seized I had
51:10
confidential material from from sources from my previous work on my laptop and
51:16
that is above all my priority is to keep my sources safe I was so scared of of
51:23
what was going to happen to aah Aaron told me that they offered him a deal and he finally just said that he
51:30
would take it if I told him to and I said I came real close to saying take
51:36
it he had these he had developed like serious political aspirations in the
51:43
intervening time between when you know that moment when he ended that
51:49
entrepreneurial startup life and begun this new life that had come to this
51:54
political activism and he just didn't believe that he could
52:01
continue in his life with a felony you know he said to me one day we were walking by the White House and he said
52:07
to me they don't let felons work [Music]
52:16
there and you know he really he really wanted that to be his life he hadn't killed anybody he hadn't
52:24
hurt anybody he hadn't like stolen money he didn't done anything that seemed felony worthy
52:31
right and there is this idea that like there's
52:37
no reason that he should be labeled a felon and taken away his right to vote in many states for doing what he did
52:44
like that's just outrageous like it makes sense for him to be you know maybe find a bunch of money or you know asked
52:51
not to come back to MIT again but like to be a felon to face
52:57
jail time Schwarz turned down the plea
53:03
deal hman redoubled his efforts Hyman continued to press us at all at all
53:11
levels even with the physical evidence seized from Aaron's Acer computer hard drive and USB drive the prosecutors
53:19
needed evidence of his motives why was Aaron Schwarz downloading articles from J store and just what did he plan to do
53:26
with them the government claims that he was planning to publish these uh we don't
53:33
really know whether that was his real intention because Aaron also had a history
53:38
of doing projects where he'd analyze giant data sets of articles in order to
53:43
learn interesting things about them the best evidence for that was that when he was at Stanford he also downloaded the
53:50
whole Westlaw legal database in a project with Stanford law students
53:55
Schwarz had had downloaded the West law legal database he uncovered troubling connections between funders of legal
54:01
research and favorable results he did this amazing analysis of for-profit
54:07
companies giving money to law professors who wrote law review articles which were then beneficial to like Exxon during an
54:14
oil spill right so it was a very corrupt system of of funding you know vanity research Schwarz had never released the
54:21
West law documents in theory he could have been doing the same thing about the J store database that would have been complet completely okay if he were on
54:28
the other hand intending to create a competitive service to J store like we're going to set up our own you know
54:35
access to the Harvard Law review and charge you know money for it then you know okay now it seems like criminal
54:41
violation uh because you're commercially trying to exploit this material but it's kind of crazy to imagine that's what he
54:46
was doing so but then there's a middle case well what if he was just trying to liberate it for all the developing
54:52
world but depending on what he was doing it creates a very different character to how the law should be thinking about it
54:58
um the government was Prosecuting him as if this was like a commercial criminal violation like stealing a whole bunch of
55:04
credit card records that was that kind of crime I don't know what he was going to do with that database but I heard
55:10
from a friend of his that Aaron had told him he was going to analyze the data for evidence of corporate funding of climate
55:17
change research that led to biased results and I I I totally believe [Music]
55:24
that I was just told that Steve wanted to talk to me um and I thought maybe this is a way
55:31
I could get out of this just just exit the situation and I didn't want to live in fear of having my computer
55:37
seized um I didn't want to live in fear of having to go to jail on a contemp of Court charge if they tried to compel me
55:44
to um decrypt my computer when they came to me and said you know Steve wants to talk to
55:49
you that seemed reasonable they offered Norton what is known as a Queen for a Day letter or a
55:56
profer it allowed prosecutors to ask questions about Aaron's case Norton would be given immunity from prosecution
56:03
herself for any information she revealed during the meeting I didn't like it I I told my lawyers repeatedly that I didn't
56:11
this seemed fishy I didn't like this I didn't want immunity I didn't need immunity I hadn't done anything but they
56:16
were really really stringent that there was they did not want me meeting the prosecutor without immunity but just to
56:22
make clear this is a Queen for a Day deal a profer right a profer letter in which basically handed information over
56:28
them in exchange for protection from prosecution so um it wasn't handing information over it was at least that's
56:34
not how I saw it it was just having a discussion having an interview with them well they're asking you questions they're asking me questions they ask
56:41
them about whatever they want right and whatever they learn I really prosecuted for that right and I I repeatedly tried
56:48
to go in naked I repeatedly I repeatedly tried to turn down the proper letter I
56:53
was ill I was being pressured by my lawyers I was confused I was not doing
56:59
well by this point I was depressed and I was scared and I didn't understand the situation I was in I had no idea why I
57:07
was in this situation I hadn't done anything interesting much less wrong we
57:13
went out of our minds Aaron was clearly very distraught about it we were very distraught about it Aaron's attorneys
57:19
were very distraught about it we tried to get Quinn to change attorneys I was very unused to being in a room with
57:26
large men well-armed that are continually telling me I'm lying and that I must have done
57:32
something I told them that this thing that they were Prosecuting
57:38
wasn't a crime I told them that they were on the wrong side of History I used that phrase
57:44
I said you're on the wrong side of History um and they look bored they
57:49
didn't even look angry they just look bored and I I it began to occur to me
57:55
that we weren't having the same conversation I mean I told them plenty of things about you know why people would download Journal articles and
58:02
eventually I don't remember what was around it um uh I mentioned that he'd
58:07
done this blog post the gorilla Open Access Manifesto uh this is the gorilla Open
58:14
Access Manifesto uh supposedly written in July 2008 in
58:19
Italy information is power but like all power there are those who want to keep it for themselves the world's entire
58:25
scientific ific and cultural heritage published over centuries in books and journals is increasingly being digitized
58:31
and locked up by a handful of private corporations meanwhile those who have been locked out are not standing idly by
58:38
you've been sneaking through holes and climbing over fences liberating the information locked up by the Publishers and sharing them with your friends but
58:44
all this action goes on in the dark hidden underground it's called stealing or piracy as if sharing a wealth of
58:50
knowledge were the moral equivalent of plundering a ship and murdering its crew but sharing isn't immoral it's a moral
58:56
imperative only those blinded by greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy
59:02
there's no justice in following unjust laws it's time to come into the light and in the grand tradition of Civil
59:07
Disobedience declare our opposition to this private theft of public culture the manifesto itself was
59:14
allegedly written by four different people and also edited by Norton but it was Schwarz who had signed his name to
59:21
it when it's over I go immediately to Aaron and tell him every I can remember
59:27
about it and he gets very
59:33
angry the things that I'd done shouldn't have added up that
59:39
way I hadn't done anything wrong and everything had gone
59:46
wrong but I was never [Music]
59:57
I'm still angry I'm still angry that you can try
1:00:03
your best with these people to do the right thing and they will turn everything against you and they will
1:00:09
hurt you with anything they [Music] can and in that moment I regret that I
1:00:17
said what I did but my much larger regret is that we have settled for this
1:00:23
that we are okay with this that we are okay with a justice system that tries to game people into little traps so they
1:00:30
can ruin their lives so yeah I wish I hadn't said that
1:00:35
but I am much much angrier that this is where I
1:00:41
am that this is what we as a people think is
1:00:47
okay they used every method that I think they could think of to get her to
1:00:53
provide information which would be unhelpful to Aaron and helpful to the prosecution of
1:00:59
Aaron but but you know I don't think she had information that was helpful to to
1:01:05
um to the government months go by as schwarz's friends and family await a looming
1:01:11
indictment in the meantime Schwarz was becoming a go-to expert on a series of
1:01:16
Internet issues to you then do you think that the internet is something that should be considered a human right and
1:01:22
something that the government cannot take away from you yes definitely I mean this notion that National Security is an
1:01:29
excuse to shut down the internet that's exactly what we heard in Egypt and Syria and all these other countries and so
1:01:34
yeah it's true sites like Wikileaks are going to be putting up some embarrassing material about what the US government does and people are going to be
1:01:40
organizing to protest about it and try and change their government you know and that's a good thing that's what all these First Amendment rights of free
1:01:47
expression a freedom of Association are all about and so the notion that we should try and shut those down I think
1:01:52
just goes against very basic American principles the principle I think is one that our founding fathers would have understood if the internet had been
1:01:58
around back then instead of putting post offices in the Constitution they would have put isps well it's definitely interesting to
1:02:05
see how Schwarz meets activist Taran Stein Brickner Kaufman and the two begin to date we need a massive Global public
1:02:11
outcry if there's no massive Global public outcry it won't create any change you know four people in this city should
1:02:17
cause a massive Global public outcry you know we need a petition signer without
1:02:22
telling her specifics he warned her he was involved in something he called simply the bad thing and I had sort of
1:02:28
crazy theories like that he was having an affair with Elizabeth Warren or something I I speculated both Hillary
1:02:34
Clinton and Elizabeth waren actually but um so sometime in probably late July
1:02:40
Aaron called me and I happened to pick up and he said you know the bad thing
1:02:45
might be in the news tomorrow do you want me to tell you or do you want to read about it in the news and I said well I want you I want you to tell me um
1:02:53
and he said uh well I've been I've been arrested for downloading too many
1:02:59
academic Journal articles and they want to make an example out of me and I was like that's it that's the
1:03:06
big fuss really like just doesn't sound like a very big deal on July 14th 2011
1:03:13
Federal prosecutors indict Schwarz on four felony accounts he gets indicted on
1:03:19
the same day that like two people in England who are part of LC get arrested
1:03:24
and like a few other real hackers and Aaron is just like someone who kind of looks like a hacker enough that they can
1:03:30
like you know put his head on a steak and like put it on the gates Aaron went to surrender and they arrested
1:03:38
him they then uh strip searched him uh took away his shoelaces took away his
1:03:44
belt and left him in solitary confinement the District of
1:03:50
Massachusetts United States attorney's office released a statement saying Schwarz faces up to 35 years in prison
1:03:57
to be followed by 3 years of supervised release restitution forfeiture and a fine of up to $1
1:04:05
million he is released on $100,000 bail the same day the primary victim in the
1:04:11
case J store formally drops all charges against Schwarz and declines to pursue
1:04:16
the case J store they weren't our friends they weren't helpful or friendly to us but they also were just kind of
1:04:22
like we're not part of this J store and their parent company Ithaca also
1:04:28
sidestepped requests to talk with this film but at the time they released a statement saying it was the government's
1:04:34
decision whether to prosecute not J stor and so it's our belief that with
1:04:40
that the case will be over that we should be able to get Steve Heyman to drop the case or settle it in some
1:04:47
rational way and the government refused
1:04:54
why well but because I think they wanted to make an example out of Aaron and they said they wanted to the reason why they
1:05:01
wouldn't move on requiring a felony conviction in jail time was that they
1:05:06
wanted uh they wanted to use this case as a case of deter for deter they told us
1:05:12
that they told you that yes this was going to be an example yes he was going to be me an example
1:05:19
yes the Steve Heyman said that deterring who like there's other people out there
1:05:24
running around logging on to J store and downloaded the Articles to make a political statement I mean who are they deterring it would be easier to
1:05:32
understand the Obama administration's posture of supposedly being for deterrence if this was an Administration
1:05:39
that for instance prosecuted arguably the biggest economic crime that this country has seen in the last 100 years
1:05:45
the crimes that were committed that led to the financial crisis on Wall Street when you start
1:05:51
deploying the non-controversial idea of detur only selectively you stopped
1:05:58
making a dispassionate analysis of lawbreaking and you started de deciding
1:06:04
to deploy law enforcement resources specifically on the basis of political
1:06:09
ideology and and that's not just undemocratic it's supposed to be
1:06:18
unamerican prosecutor Steven Heyman later reportedly told mit's outside Council that the straw that broke the
1:06:25
camp back was a press release sent out by an organization Schwarz founded called demand progress according to the
1:06:32
MIT account Heyman reacted to the short statement of support calling it a wild
1:06:37
internet campaign and a foolish move that moved the case from a human one-on one level to an Institutional level that
1:06:44
was a a poisonous combination a prosecutor who didn't want to lose face who had a political career and the
1:06:50
offing maybe and and didn't want to have this come back and haunt them you spent how many tax dollars arrest someone for
1:06:56
taking too many books out of the library and they got your ass handed to you in court no way I then mve to try to put
1:07:02
his pressure on it in various ways to get them to go to the government and and request the government to to to stop the
1:07:10
prosecution but what is mit's reaction that there doesn't seem to be any
1:07:15
reaction from MIT at that
1:07:22
point MIT doesn't defend Aaron which to people inside of the MIT Community seems
1:07:29
outrageous because MIT is a place that encourages hacking in the biggest sense
1:07:35
of the word at MIT the idea of going and running around on roofs and tunnels that you weren't allowed to be in was not
1:07:41
only a right of passage it was part of the MIT tour and lockpicking was a
1:07:48
winter course at MIT they had the moral authority to stop
1:07:54
it in it tracks MIT never stood up and took a position of saying to the feds
1:08:00
don't do this we don't want you to do this you're you're overreacting this is too strong that I'm aware
1:08:07
of they acted kind of like a like any Corporation would they they sort of they
1:08:13
they helped the government they didn't help us unless they felt they had to and
1:08:18
um and they never tried to stop it MIT declined repeated requests to comment
1:08:25
but later released a report saying they attempted to maintain a position of neutrality and believed himman and the
1:08:31
US attorney's office did not care what MIT thought or said about the case mit's Behavior seemed really at odds with the
1:08:40
MIT ethos right you could argue that MIT turned a blind eye and that was okay for
1:08:46
them to do but taking that stance taking that neutral stance in of itself was taking a pro prosecutor stance if you
1:08:53
look at Steve Jobs and Steve wnc they started by selling a blue box which was
1:08:59
a thing designed to defraud the phone company if you look at Bill Gates and Paul Allen they initially started their
1:09:05
business by using computer time at Harvard which was pretty clearly against the rules the difference between Aaron
1:09:12
and the people I just mentioned is that Aaron wanted to make the world a better place he didn't just want to make
1:09:18
money shorts continues to be outspoken on a variety of Internet issues you know
1:09:23
the reason the internet works is because of the competitive Marketplace of ideas and what we need to be focusing on is
1:09:30
getting more information about our government more accessibility more discussion more debate but instead it
1:09:35
seems like what Congress is focused on is shutting things down Aaron thought he could change the world just by
1:09:41
explaining the world very clearly to people flame can literally control your computer and make it spy on you welcome
1:09:49
Aaron good to have you back on the show here you know just like spies used to in olden days put microphones and tap what
1:09:55
people were saying now they're using computers to do the same things schwarz's political activity continues
1:10:01
his attention turning to a bill moving through Congress designed to curb online piracy it was called soapa activists
1:10:09
like Peter Eckersley saw it as an enormous overreach threatening the technical Integrity of the internet
1:10:15
itself and one of the first things I did was to call Aaron I said can we do a big online campaign against this this isn't
1:10:22
a bill about copyright it's not not no he said it's a
1:10:27
bill about the freedom to connect now I was listening and he
1:10:33
thought about it for a while and then said yes and he went and founded demand progress demand progress is an online
1:10:39
activism organization we' got around a million and a half members now um but
1:10:44
started in the fall of 2010 Aaron was one of the most prominent people and a community of people who help lead
1:10:51
organizing around social justice issues at the federal level in this country soapa was the bill that was intended to
1:10:58
curtail online piracy of music and movies but what it did was basically
1:11:03
take a sledgehammer to a problem that needed a scalpel if passed the law would
1:11:08
allow a company to cut off finances to entire websites without due process or
1:11:13
even to force Google to exclude their links all they needed was a single claim of copyright infringement it pitted the
1:11:21
titans of traditional media against a new and now far more sophistic at remix culture it makes everyone who runs a
1:11:28
website into a policeman and if they don't do their job of making sure nobody on their site uses it for anything
1:11:33
that's even potentially illegal the entire site can get shut down without even so much as a trial this was over
1:11:39
the top I mean this was uh a catastrophe this bill poses a serious threat to
1:11:46
speech and civil liberties for all who use the internet there were only a
1:11:52
handful of us who said look we're not for piracy either but it makes no sense
1:11:57
to destroy the architecture or the internet the domain name system and so much that makes it free and open in the
1:12:03
name of fighting uh piracy and Aaron got that right away the freedoms guaranteed in our constitution the freedoms our
1:12:10
country had been built on would be suddenly deleted new technology instead
1:12:15
of bringing us greater Freedom would have snuffed out fundamental rights we'd always taken for
1:12:20
granted and I realized that day talking to Peter that I couldn't let that
1:12:27
happen when soapa was introduced in October 2011 it was considered
1:12:32
inevitable our strategy when it first came out was to hopefully slow the bill down maybe weaken it a little bit uh but
1:12:40
even we didn't think that we would be able to stop this bill having worked in Washington what
1:12:47
you learn is that typically in Washington the legislative fights are
1:12:53
fights between different sets of corporate moneyed interests they're all duking it out to pass legislation and
1:13:00
the the fights that are the closest are when you have one set of corporate interests against another set of
1:13:06
corporate interests and they're financially equally matched in terms of campaign contributions and lobbying those are the closest ones the ones that
1:13:13
aren't even fights typically are ones where all the money is on one side all
1:13:18
the corporations are on one side and just millions of people on the other
1:13:24
side I haven't seen anything like Pippa and soapa in all my time in public
1:13:30
service there were more than 40 United State Senators on that bill as
1:13:36
co-sponsors so they were already a long long way to getting the 60 votes to have
1:13:41
it clear all the procedural Hoops even I began to doubt myself it it
1:13:46
was a rough period Schwarz and demand progress were able to Marshall enormous support using traditional Outreach
1:13:53
combined with commonly used voice Voiceover IP to make it very easy for people to call Congress I have never met
1:14:00
anybody else who was able to operate at his level both on the technological side and on the campaign strategy side
1:14:08
millions of people contacted Congress and signed anti-sopa petitions Congress
1:14:13
was caught off guard there was just something about watching those clueless members of Congress debate the bill
1:14:20
watching them insist they could regulate the internet and a bunch of nerds couldn't possibly stop them I am not a
1:14:25
nerd I'm just not enough of a nerd maybe we ought to ask some nerds what this thing really does let's have a hearing
1:14:31
bring in the Nerds
1:14:39
really nerds you know I think actually the word you're looking for is
1:14:45
experts to Enlighten you so your laws don't backfire break the internet we use
1:14:53
the term geek but we're allowed to use that because we are Geeks the fact that it got as far as it did without them
1:15:00
talking to any technical experts reflects the fact that there is a problem in this town I'm looking for
1:15:05
somebody to come before this body and testify in a hearing and say this is why
1:15:11
they're wrong there used to be an office that provided Science and Technology advice and members could go to them and
1:15:16
say help me understand XYZ and gri killed it he said it was a waste of money ever since then Congress has
1:15:23
plunged into the dark ages I don't think anybody really thought that soapa could be beaten including Aaron I think it was
1:15:30
worth trying but it didn't seem winnable and I remember maybe a few months later
1:15:36
I remember him just turning to me and being like I think we might win this and I was like that would be
1:15:43
amazing calls to Congress continue when the domain hosting site GoDaddy becomes
1:15:48
a supporter of the bill tens of thousands of users transferred their domain names in protest within a week a
1:15:56
humbled GoDaddy reverses their position on sofa uh when the U Congress people
1:16:02
that supported uh the the record in movie Industries uh realized that there was this backlash they kind of scaled
1:16:09
the bill back a little bit you can see the curve happening you could see that we were that that our uh arguments were
1:16:14
starting to resonate it was like Aaron had been like striking a match and it was being blown out striking another one is being blown out and finally he'd like
1:16:21
managed to catch enough kindling that the the flame actually caught and then they turned into into this roaring Blaze
1:16:27
on January 16th 2012 the White House issued a statement saying they didn't
1:16:32
support the bill and then this happened I'm a big believer that uh we should be
1:16:38
dealing with issues of piracy and we should deal with them in a serious way uh but this bill is not the right bill
1:16:44
when Jimmy Wales uh put his support towards blacking out Wikipedia the number five most popular website in the
1:16:51
world this is a website that's on several per of all of the clicks on
1:16:57
anywhere on the internet Wikipedia went black Reddit went black Craigslist went black the phone lines on Capitol Hill
1:17:04
flat out melted members of Congress started rushing to issue statements retracting their support for the bill
1:17:11
that they were promoting just a couple days ago within 24 hours the number of opponents of soapa in Congress went from
1:17:18
this to [Music] this to see congressman and Senators
1:17:25
slowly flip sides throughout the day of the blackout was pretty unbelievable
1:17:31
there was like a hundred representative swing and that was when as hard as it was for me to believe after all this we
1:17:39
had won the thing that everyone said was impossible that some of the biggest companies in the world had written off
1:17:44
as kind of a pipe dream had happened we did
1:17:50
it we won
1:17:55
this is a historic week in Internet politics maybe American politics the thing that we heard from people in
1:18:01
Washington DC from staffers on Capitol Hill was they received more emails and more phone calls on so blackout day than
1:18:08
they'd ever received about anything I think that was an extremely exciting moment this was the moment when the
1:18:15
internet had grown up politically it was exhilarating because it's hard to believe it actually happened it's hard
1:18:21
to believe a bill with so much Financial power behind it didn't simply sail
1:18:27
through the Congress and not only did it not sail through it didn't pass at
1:18:32
all you know it's easy sometimes to feel like you're powerless like when you come out in the streets and you march and you
1:18:38
yell and nobody hears you but I'm here to tell you today you are [Applause]
1:18:44
powerful so yeah maybe sometimes you feel like you're not being listened to but I'm here to tell you that you are
1:18:50
you are being listened to you are making a difference you can stop this bill if if you don't stop
1:18:56
[Music] fighting stop Pippa stop
1:19:02
[Music] soapa some of the biggest internet companies to put it frankly would benefit from a world in which their
1:19:08
little competitors could get censored we can't let that
1:19:14
happen for him it was more important to be sure that you made a small change
1:19:19
than to play a small part in a big change but Soo was like playing a major
1:19:25
part in a major change and so for him it was kind of this proof of concept like
1:19:31
okay I you know what I want to do with my life has changed the world I think about it in this really scientific way
1:19:37
of like I'm measuring my impact and this shows that it's possible right that the
1:19:42
thing that I want to do with my life is possible um I have proved that I that I
1:19:47
can do it that iron sorts could change the world for a guy who um never really
1:19:54
thought he had done much which was eron um it was one of the few moments where
1:20:00
you could really see that he felt like he had he had done something good feeling like here is his
1:20:09
maybe one and only Victory lap everyone said there was no way we
1:20:15
could stop sofa we stopped it there a three outrageously good victories and
1:20:20
the year isn't even over yet I mean if there's a time to be positive it's now [Music]
1:20:27
you know he wins at soapa a year after he's arrested it's not unambiguously happy moment there's a lot going on he's
1:20:33
so attuned towards participating in the political process you can't stop him the
1:20:40
list of organizations Schwarz founded or co-founded is enormous and years before Edward Snowden would expose widespread
1:20:47
internet surveillance Schwarz was already concerned it is shocking to think that the accountability is so
1:20:54
lacked that they don't even have sort of basic statistics about how big the spying program is if the answer is oh
1:21:00
we're spying on so many people we can't possibly even count them then that's an awful lot of people right one thing if
1:21:06
they said look you know we we know the number of telephones we're spying on we don't know exactly how many real people
1:21:11
that corresponds to but they just came back and said we can't give you a number at all that's pretty I mean it's scary
1:21:17
is what it is well that's scary you know they put incredible pressure on him and took away his um you know his all of the
1:21:24
money he had made they you know threatened to take away his physical Freedom why' they do it you know I mean
1:21:31
well why why are they going after whistleblowers you know why are they going after people who tell the you know
1:21:37
who tell the truth about all sorts of things I mean from the banks to the um
1:21:43
you know to war to just sort of government transparency so secrecy serves those who are already in power
1:21:49
and we are living in an era of secrecy that coincides with an era where the government is doing also a lot of things
1:21:55
that are probably illegal and unconstitutional so those two things are not coincidences it's very clear that
1:22:02
this technology has been developed not for small countries overseas but right here for use in the United States by the
1:22:09
US government SP program is it's this sort of long slow expansion you know
1:22:14
going back to the Nixon Administration right obviously it became big after 911 under George W bush and Obama has
1:22:20
continued to expand it and the problems have slowly grown worse and worse but there's never been this moment you can
1:22:25
point to say okay we need to Galvanize opposition today because today is when it matters instead it's mattered the
1:22:32
prosecution in my estimation of Aaron Schwarz was about sending a particular laser-like message to a group of people
1:22:41
that the Obama Administration sees as politically
1:22:46
threatening and that is essentially the hacker the information and the Democracy
1:22:52
activist community and the message that the O the Obama Administration wanted to send to that particular Community was in
1:22:59
my estimation we know you have the ability to make trouble for the establishment and so we are going to try
1:23:06
to make an example out of Aaron Schwarz to scare as many of you as possible into
1:23:12
not making that trouble and the government said oh the legal opinions we're using to legalize the spying
1:23:18
program are also classified so we can't even tell you which laws we're using to spy on you you know every time say oh
1:23:24
this is another instance of cyber War the Cyber criminals are attacking us again we're all in danger we're all under threat they use those as excuses
1:23:31
to push through more and more dangerous laws and so just to follow that up like
1:23:37
personally how how do you feel the fight is going I guess it's up to you I know
1:23:43
but we gotta like you know you
1:23:49
know there's sort of these two polarizing perspectives right everything is great the internet has created all
1:23:54
the this freedom and liberty and everything's going to be fantastic or everything is terrible the internet has created all these tools for cracking
1:24:00
down and spying and you know controlling what we say and I think is both are true
1:24:05
right the internet has done both and both are kind of amazing and astonishing and which one will win out in the long
1:24:11
run is up to us it doesn't make sense to say oh one is doing better than the other you know they're both true and
1:24:17
it's up to us which ones we emphasize and which ones we take advantage of because they're both there and they're both always going to be there
1:24:29
on September 12th 2012 Federal prosecutors filed a superseding indictment against Schwarz adding
1:24:35
additional counts of wire fraud unauthorized access to a computer and computer fraud now instead of four
1:24:41
felony counts Schwarz was facing 13 The prosecution's Leverage had dramatically
1:24:47
increased as did schwarz's potential jail time and fines they filed a
1:24:53
separate indictment to had more charges and they had a theory about why this
1:24:58
conduct constituted a number of federal crimes and that a very significant sentence could attach to it under the
1:25:06
law that theory and much of the prosecution's case against Schwarz involved a law created originally in
1:25:13
1986 it is called the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act was inspired by the movie War Games
1:25:19
with Matthew brck which a great movie I have you now in this movie kid gets the
1:25:25
ability through the magic of computer networks to like launch a nuclear
1:25:32
attack you know that's not actually possible and it certainly wasn't possible in the 80s but apparently this
1:25:38
movie Scared Congress enough to um pass the the original Computer Fraud and
1:25:44
Abuse Act this is a law that's just behind the times for example that penalizes uh terms of service kinds of
1:25:52
Arrangements you can have something like e-harmony or Match.com and somebody sort
1:25:58
of inflates uh their own personal characteristics and all of a sudden depending on the jurisdiction and the
1:26:04
prosecutors they could be in a whole host of troubles we all know what terms of use are most people don't read them
1:26:12
but not abiding by their terms could mean you are committing a felony the website terms of service often say
1:26:18
things like be nice to each other or don't do anything that's improper the idea that the criminal law has anything
1:26:24
to say about these kinds of violations I think strikes most people as crazy the examples get even more crazy
1:26:33
until it was changed in March of 2013 the terms of use on the website of hurst's 17 magazine said you had to be
1:26:41
18 in order to read it I would say that the way the CFA has been interpreted by the justice department we are probably
1:26:47
all Breaking the Law vague and prone to misuse the cfaa
1:26:52
has become a one-size fitsa small hammer for a wide range of computer related disputes though not the only factor in
1:26:59
his case 11 of the 13 charges against Schwarz involved the Computer Fraud and Abuse
1:27:06
Act the question why hangs over much of the story of Aaron Schwarz just what was
1:27:12
motivating the government and what would their case have been the Department of Justice declined requests for answers
1:27:19
but Professor Orin Kerr is a former prosecutor who has studied the case so I think I come about this case from a
1:27:25
different direction than other people on a number of reasons I was a federal prosecutor at the justice department for 3 years before I started teaching the
1:27:32
government came forward with an indictment based on uh what crimes they thought were committed uh just as a
1:27:38
purely lawyers matter looking at the Precedence looking at the statute looking at the history looking at the
1:27:44
cases that are out there so far uh I think it was a fair indictment based on that you can debate whether they should
1:27:50
have charged this case there's just a lot of disagreement some people are on you know the Open Access side some
1:27:55
people are not I think the government took schwarz's Guerilla Open Access Manifesto
1:28:02
very seriously uh and I think they saw him as somebody who was committed as a
1:28:08
moral imperative to breaking the law to overcome a law that Schwartz saw is
1:28:14
unjust and in a democracy if you think a law is unjust there are ways of changing
1:28:20
that law there're going to Congress as Schwartz did so masterfully with soapa uh or you can violate that law in a way
1:28:26
to try to nullify that law and I think what was driving the prosecution was the
1:28:32
sense that Schwarz was committed not just to breaking the law but to really making sure that law was nullified that
1:28:40
everyone would have access to the database in a way that you couldn't put the toothpaste back into the TU it would
1:28:47
be done and schwarz's side would win there's a big disagreement in
1:28:53
society as to whether that is an unjust law and ultimately that's a decision for the American people to make working
1:28:59
through Congress and then the second problem is I think we're still trying to figure out what's the line between less
1:29:05
serious offenses and more serious offenses we're now entering this different environment of computers and
1:29:11
computer misuse and we don't yet have a really strong sense of exactly what these lines are we're just working that
1:29:18
out this is a poor use of prosecutorial discretion the hammer that the justice
1:29:23
department has to scare people with is it just gets bigger and bigger and bigger and so most people just you know
1:29:30
you can't roll the dice with your life like that should we tap somebody's phone should we film them should we turn
1:29:36
somebody and get them to testify against these other people that's how federal agents and prosecutors think they build
1:29:43
cases they make cases Schwartz was caught in the gears of a brutal criminal justice system that
1:29:50
could not turn back a machine that has made America the country with the highest rate of incarceration in the
1:29:56
world we have in this country allowed ourselves to be captured by the politics
1:30:01
of fear and anger and anything we're afraid of like the future of the
1:30:06
internet and access and anything we're angry about instinctively creates a
1:30:12
criminal justice intervention and we've used jail prison and Punishment to
1:30:17
resolve a whole host of problems that historically were never seen as criminal justice problems the impulse to threaten
1:30:25
indict prosecute which is part of what has created this debate and controversy over online access and information on
1:30:31
the Internet is very consistent with what we've seen in other areas the one difference is is that the people are
1:30:37
usually targeted uh and victimized by these kinds of criminal and carceral responses
1:30:43
are typically poor in minority schwarz's isolation from
1:30:48
friends and family increased he had basically stopped working on anything else and the case was was in fact like
1:30:55
taking over sort of his whole life one of Aaron's lawyers apparently told the prosecutors that he he was emotionally
1:31:02
vulnerable and that that was something that they really needed to keep in mind so that they they knew that it was
1:31:07
weighing on him very heavily he did not like having his actions and his
1:31:12
movements restricted in any way and the threat of jail which they pounded him
1:31:19
with a lot was terrifying to him completely exhausted his financial resources and it
1:31:27
cost us a lot of money also and he raised a substantial amount of money so it was you know it was in the millions
1:31:35
of dollars the legal defense yes was in millions
1:31:40
yes yeah I think he didn't want to be a burden to people I think that was a factor like I have my normal life and
1:31:47
then I have this shitty thing I have to deal with and I try to like keep the two of them as separate as possible but they
1:31:53
were just beginning to blur together and everything was becoming shitty Schwarz faced a tough choice that
1:32:00
was only getting tougher do you admit guilt and move on with your life or do you fight a broken system with his legal
1:32:07
case the answer was simple he rejects the final plea deal and a trial date is set Aaron was was Resolute that he
1:32:14
didn't want to knuckle under and accept something that he didn't believe was fair but I also think he was
1:32:20
[Music] scared
1:32:52
e
1:33:22
e e
1:34:17
I could tell something was wrong and then I I called and I realized what had
1:34:22
happened a co-founder of the social news and entertainment website Reddit has been found dead police say 26-year-old
1:34:30
Aaron Schwartz killed himself yesterday in his Brooklyn [Music]
1:34:36
apartment I just thought we've lost one of
1:34:43
the most creative minds of our generation is like the whole world fell apart in that moment um
1:34:52
[Music] that was one of the hardest nights in my
1:34:59
life so I kept screaming I can't hear you what did you say I can't hear
1:35:06
you I can't that's
1:35:16
it uh like yeah none of it made any sense
1:35:22
and really still doesn't I was so frustrated
1:35:27
[Music]
1:35:37
angry you know I tried to explain it to my
1:35:42
kids my three-year-old told me that the doctors would fix
1:35:51
him I've known lots of people have died but I've never lost anybody like this because everybody feels than I do
1:35:58
too there is so much we could have more to do like uh just didn't know he was
1:36:05
there I didn't know this is what he was suffering and he was part of
1:36:13
[Music] me and I just wanted it to not be
1:36:18
real and then
1:36:24
and then I just looked at his Wikipedia page and I saw the end
1:36:31
date 2
1:36:37
[Music] 2013 Aon is
1:36:44
dead Wanderers in this crazy world we have lost a mentor a wise Elder hackers
1:36:51
for right we're one down we've lost one of our own nurturers carers listeners feeders
1:37:01
parents all we have lost a child let us all
1:37:13
weep my first thought was what if nobody even notices and you know because it wasn't
1:37:19
clear to me how Salient he was I had never seen anything quite like the
1:37:28
outpouring I saw the net just lit up I mean everyone was trying to to explain it in their own way but
1:37:36
I've never seen people grieve on Twitter before people were visibly grieving
1:37:45
online he was The Internet's Own Boy and the old world killed him
1:37:55
we are standing in the middle of a time when great Injustice is not
1:38:00
touched architects of the financial meltdown have dinner with the president regularly in the middle of that time the
1:38:08
idea that this was what the government had to prosecute just seems absurd if it
1:38:16
weren't tragic the question is can we do something given what's happened to make
1:38:23
the world a better place and how can we further that Legacy that's the only question one can
1:38:32
ask all over the world there were starting to be hackathons and Gatherings
1:38:37
and Aaron Schwarz as some sense brought the best out of us and trying to say how
1:38:43
do we fix this he was in my humble opinion one of
1:38:49
the true extraordinary revolutionaries that this country has produced I don't
1:38:55
know whether Aaron was defeated or Victorious uh but we are certainly shaped by the hand uh of the things that
1:39:04
he wrestled with when we turn armed agents of the law on citizens trying to
1:39:10
increase access to knowledge we've broken the rule of law we've desecrated the Temple of Justice Aaron Schwarz was
1:39:18
not a criminal change does not roll in on the
1:39:23
wheels of inevitability it comes through continuous
1:39:28
struggle Aaron really could do magic and I'm dedicated to making sure that his
1:39:34
magic doesn't end with his death he believed that he could change the world and he was
1:39:39
right out of the last week and out of today phoenixes are already
1:39:46
Rising since schwarz's death representative zo lran and Senator Ron
1:39:51
weiden have introduced legislation that would form the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act the outdated law that formed the
1:39:57
majority of the charges against Schwarz it's called Aaron's law Aaron believed
1:40:04
that like you literally ought to be asking yourself all of the time what is the most important thing I could be working on in the world right now and if
1:40:11
you're not working on that why aren't
1:40:20
youed stand internet freedom
1:40:27
[Music]
1:40:33
I wish we could change the past but we cannot but we can change the future and
1:40:39
we must we must do so for Aaron we must do so for ourselves we must do so to
1:40:45
make our world a better place a more Humane place a place where Justice works
1:40:50
and access to knowledge becomes a human right so there was a kid back in
1:40:56
February from uh Baltimore uh 14 years old who uh had access to J store and
1:41:05
he'd been spelunking through J store after reading something and he figured out a way to do early tests for
1:41:12
pancreatic cancer and pancreatic cancer kills the [ __ ] out of you because we detect it way
1:41:19
too late by the time we detect it it's already too late to do anything about it uh and um he sent emails off to the
1:41:25
entire on oncology department at John's Hopkins you know hundreds of them and every 14-year-old kid yeah and most of
1:41:32
them ignored it right but one of them like sent him an email back and said this is not an entirely stupid idea would you comeing over this kid worked
1:41:39
evenings and weekends with this researcher and in February I heard him on the news just a couple of weeks after
1:41:44
Aaron died when Aaron was in the news a [Music]
1:41:50
lot sorry and uh he said um the reason he was on
1:41:56
the news is because they'd done it they were shipping uh an early test for pancreatic cancer that was going to save
1:42:02
lives and he said uh this is why what Aaron did was so
1:42:09
important because you never know right um this this truth of the universe is not only something that policy makers
1:42:16
use to figure out you know what the speed limit should be it's where the the thing that's going to keep you know your
1:42:22
kid from dying of pancreatic cancer comes from and without access the person who
1:42:29
might come up with a thing that's got your number on it may never find that
1:42:34
answer he sleeped so well he didn't fall out of De once not even when he dreamed he
1:42:44
was back on the spacecraft very good Aon very good yeah
1:42:51
okay now it's gone time

I wanted to use it to argue against the myth of child prodigy
Using "The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz" to argue against the myth of the child prodigy is an intriguing angle. The myth often portrays child prodigies as effortless geniuses destined for greatness, implying that their success is inevitable due to innate talent alone. Aaron Swartz's story, as depicted in the documentary, provides a rich counter-narrative: his achievements were not just a product of precocious talent but of curiosity, hard work, collaboration, and a deep commitment to challenging systems—qualities that developed over time and were shaped by his environment and choices. Moreover, his tragic end underscores that the prodigy label can oversimplify a complex life, ignoring external pressures and personal struggles. Let's break this down and craft an argument using the transcript.
Argument: Aaron Swartz's Life Debunks the Child Prodigy Myth
1. Talent Alone Didn't Define His Success—It Was Curiosity and Effort
The myth suggests prodigies are born with fully formed abilities, but Aaron's story shows his brilliance emerged from an insatiable curiosity and proactive learning, not just innate genius. The transcript notes how he "learned how to learn at a very, very young age" (3:06) and taught himself to read by age three (3:44-3:52), astonishing his family. Yet, this wasn't effortless magic—his brother recalls him coming home from algebra class eager to teach it (4:31), and his early programming, like a Star Wars trivia game in BASIC (5:20), involved hours of collaborative effort with his father. His creation of theinfo.org at 12 (6:27), a precursor to Wikipedia, wasn't a spontaneous gift but a deliberate attempt to solve a problem he identified: sharing knowledge. These examples illustrate that Aaron's "prodigy" status stemmed from persistent exploration and application, not just a preloaded talent package.
2. Collaboration, Not Solitary Genius, Fueled His Achievements
The prodigy myth often paints a lone genius, but Aaron's contributions—like RSS, Creative Commons, and Reddit—relied heavily on collaboration. At 14, he joined the RSS working group (8:08), where his ideas stood out not because he worked in isolation but because he engaged with a community, despite being too young for face-to-face meetings (8:31). Lawrence Lessig trusted him to architect Creative Commons licenses (14:16), a role that required integrating technical skill with others' visions, not solitary brilliance. Reddit's success (18:29) came from merging his Infogami project with Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian's work, showing how his impact grew through teamwork. This contradicts the myth's focus on individual exceptionalism, highlighting that Aaron's "prodigious" output was a collective effort shaped by his ability to connect and contribute.
3. The Prodigy Label Ignores Context and Struggle
The myth implies a smooth path to glory, but Aaron's life was marked by resistance, frustration, and systemic pushback. He hated school (11:21), finding it stifling, and dropped out of Stanford after a year (17:24), rejecting the traditional prodigy pipeline. His activism—downloading PACER documents (33:50) or JSTOR articles (40:24)—drew FBI scrutiny and prosecution, not praise. The transcript reveals how the government's pursuit, escalating to 13 felony counts under the CFAA (1:24:35), drained his resources and spirit, costing millions in legal fees (1:31:27). Far from a triumphant prodigy arc, his story ends in tragedy at 26 (1:34:22), driven by pressures the myth doesn't account for. Calling him a prodigy oversimplifies this, masking the societal forces that crushed him.
4. His "Victory" Wasn't Inevitable—It Was a Choice Against Odds
The SOPA victory (1:17:44) is often cited as a prodigy's crowning achievement, but the transcript shows it was neither guaranteed nor a solo feat. Aaron co-founded Demand Progress (1:10:33) and rallied millions, yet he initially doubted success (1:15:23), saying, "It didn't seem winnable." The blackout of Wikipedia and Reddit (1:16:44) turned the tide, a collective action he catalyzed, not conjured alone. The myth would frame this as destiny, but Aaron's scientific approach—"measuring my impact" (1:19:37)—shows it was a calculated risk, not a preordained win. His death soon after (1:34:22) further shatters the narrative of inevitable triumph, proving prodigies don't automatically conquer all.
5. The Prodigy Myth Reduces a Life to a Label
Finally, the outpouring after Aaron's death (1:37:28) reveals a legacy far beyond "prodigy." He was a mentor, activist, and revolutionary (1:38:49), not just a wunderkind. The myth flattens this into a tale of early brilliance, ignoring his evolution and the cost of his ideals. His mother's fear of FBI visits (34:34), his partner's regret over legal traps (1:00:17), and his own despair (1:31:53) show a human, not a mythic figure. The 14-year-old inspired by his JSTOR access to develop a pancreatic cancer test (1:41:05) reflects Aaron's real impact—enabling others—something the prodigy trope can't capture.
Conclusion
Aaron Swartz's life, as told in the documentary, dismantles the child prodigy myth. His brilliance wasn't a gift dropped from the sky but a product of curiosity, effort, and collaboration. His path wasn't smooth or inevitable—it was fraught with resistance, requiring choices that led to both victories like SOPA and crushing defeats like his prosecution. The label "prodigy" reduces this complex, impactful life to a simplistic fairy tale, ignoring the struggles and systemic failures that shaped it. Aaron wasn't a prodigy who effortlessly soared; he was a person who fought, connected, and paid a price the myth can't explain.
How's this? I've tailored it to use the transcript as evidence, focusing on debunking the myth's assumptions. If you'd like to refine it—say, for an essay, debate, or specific audience—let me know how to adjust!
That's a provocative angle and one that opens up a rich debate about the influence of individualism and objectivism on shaping influential personalities and their impacts on society and the environment. Here's how you could break down this argument for each of these figures:

### 1. **Elon Musk**
- **Critique:** Known for his ambitious and often unilateral decision-making in companies like Tesla and SpaceX, Musk's approach can be seen as a byproduct of a culture that celebrates disruptive individualism. His interactions on social media and with regulators sometimes reflect a disdain for criticism and a preference for personal ideology over collaborative input.
- **Environmental Impact:** While Musk contributes to green technology with electric cars and solar energy, his ventures like SpaceX raise concerns about environmental and space pollution.

### 2. **Jeff Bezos**
- **Critique:** Bezos's leadership style at Amazon has been characterized by high demands and intense work culture, which some argue stem from his high personal standards and objectivist leanings. His response to criticism, especially regarding workplace practices and Amazon's initial resistance to unionization, highlights a possible intolerance to opposing viewpoints.
- **Environmental Impact:** Amazon's massive operational scale contributes significantly to carbon emissions, although Bezos has pledged substantial funds for climate change mitigation through the Bezos Earth Fund.

### 3. **Steve Jobs**
- **Critique:** Jobs was renowned for his perfectionism and demanding personality, often pushing his employees to their limits to achieve his vision. This approach can be seen as a result of individualistic ideals that prioritize personal vision over collective welfare.
- **Environmental Impact:** Apple has faced criticism for its environmental impact and the sustainability of its products, though it has made strides in improving these areas over time.

### 4. **Bill Gates**
- **Critique:** Gates's early career was marked by aggressive business tactics to establish Microsoft's dominance, often criticized as monopolistic and detrimental to a more cooperative industry environment. While he's shifted toward philanthropy, his past business practices reflect a strong individualistic drive.
- **Environmental Impact:** Microsoft has been implicated in contributing to e-waste and energy consumption, though like Apple, it has made commitments to reducing its environmental footprint.

### 5. **Justin Bieber**
- **Critique:** As a young star thrust into fame, Bieber's early public behavior was often viewed as brattish, reflecting a possible outcome of being idolized from a young age. His handling of fame and criticism has matured, but his early years reflect the pitfalls of excessive individual praise without corresponding accountability.
- **Environmental Impact:** While not directly linked to large-scale environmental issues, Bieber's lifestyle and influence as a celebrity contribute to the culture of consumption and waste associated with celebrity lifestyles.

### Argument Structure
This argument could be structured around the idea that extreme individualism, often fueled by objectivist philosophy, not only shapes the personal and managerial styles of these figures but also affects their ethical and environmental decisions. It suggests that while such ideals can drive innovation and economic success, they may also foster leadership styles and business practices that are detrimental to social and environmental welfare.

### Conclusion
This critique proposes a need for a balanced approach that considers ethical leadership and sustainable practices as integral to true success, challenging the narrative that individual achievement should be pursued at all costs. This perspective invites a discussion about how societal values shape influential personalities and the broader implications of their actions and policies.
It seems like there's a bit of a mix-up here! Your latest response introduces a new argument comparing Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Justin Bieber, focusing on how individualism and objectivism shape their personalities, leadership styles, and environmental impacts. However, my previous response was tailored to your request to use Aaron Swartz's story from "The Internet's Own Boy" to argue against the child prodigy myth. I'll assume you're either pivoting to a new topic or wanting to blend these ideas. Since your prompt mentions "these figures" after my Swartz argument, I'll interpret this as a request to integrate Swartz into this new framework, treating him as a counterpoint to the individualism/objectivism critique. If I've misunderstood, please clarify!
Here's how we can weave Aaron Swartz into your new argument, contrasting his approach with the five figures you listed, to explore how individualism and objectivism influence personalities and their societal/environmental impacts—while still challenging the prodigy myth.
Argument: Individualism, Objectivism, and the Myth of the Prodigy—Aaron Swartz vs. Musk, Bezos, Jobs, Gates, and Bieber
Premise
The cultural valorization of individualism and objectivism—philosophies emphasizing personal achievement and self-interest—often underpins the "child prodigy" myth, framing exceptional individuals as solitary geniuses destined to dominate. Figures like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and even Justin Bieber exemplify how this mindset can drive innovation and fame but also foster self-centered leadership and questionable societal/environmental outcomes. Aaron Swartz, however, offers a counter-narrative: a supposed "prodigy" whose life rejects individualism's excesses, prioritizing collective good over personal gain, yet still suffering under systemic pressures. This comparison reveals the limits of the prodigy myth and the broader impacts of individualistic ideologies.
1. Elon Musk: Disruptive Individualism at a Cost
Individualism/Objectivism:
Musk's relentless pursuit of his vision—electric cars, space colonization—reflects an objectivist belief in the primacy of individual will. His combative stance on X and with regulators (e.g., Tesla's safety critiques) shows a disdain for external constraints, aligning with a "prodigy" narrative of bending the world to his genius.
Societal/Environmental Impact:
Tesla advances sustainable transport, but SpaceX's rocket launches contribute to atmospheric pollution and space debris, raising questions about unchecked ambition.
Contrast with Swartz:
Swartz, too, was a tech visionary, co-creating RSS at 14 (8:08). Yet, unlike Musk's profit-driven empire-building, Swartz's work aimed to democratize knowledge (e.g., PACER, 33:50). His "prodigy" wasn't about personal glory but collective access, debunking the myth's focus on solitary triumph.
2. Jeff Bezos: Scale Through Singular Control
Individualism/Objectivism:
Bezos's Amazon empire reflects an objectivist drive for efficiency and dominance, often at the expense of workers (e.g., resistance to unions). His initial dismissal of criticism mirrors the prodigy myth's assumption of infallible brilliance.
Societal/Environmental Impact:
Amazon's carbon footprint is vast, though offset by the Bezos Earth Fund. This duality suggests a late pivot to responsibility, not an inherent ethic.
Contrast with Swartz:
Swartz rejected corporate life (22:51), leaving Reddit's sale to Condé Nast to pursue activism. His fight against JSTOR's paywalls (40:24) prioritized public good over profit, clashing with Bezos's model and showing "prodigy" as a collaborative, not dictatorial, force.
3. Steve Jobs: Perfectionism Over People
Individualism/Objectivism:
Jobs's perfectionism and abrasive style at Apple embody an individualistic belief that his vision justified any means. The prodigy myth casts him as a lone genius, ignoring team contributions.
Societal/Environmental Impact:
Apple's early e-waste issues contrast with later sustainability efforts, hinting at a shift prompted by external pressure, not intrinsic values.
Contrast with Swartz:
Swartz's Creative Commons work (14:16) relied on collaboration with Lessig, not unilateral control. His discomfort with Stanford's "babysitting program" (17:04) rejects the prodigy's anointed path, favoring self-directed impact over institutional glory.
4. Bill Gates: Monopolistic Beginnings, Philanthropic Turn
Individualism/Objectivism:
Gates's early Microsoft tactics—aggressive competition, monopolistic practices—reflect objectivist self-interest, framing him as a prodigy mastering the market. His philanthropy later softens this image.
Societal/Environmental Impact:
Microsoft's e-waste legacy persists, though carbon-neutral pledges show reform. This evolution suggests individualism tempered by reflection.
Contrast with Swartz:
Swartz's Westlaw analysis (53:50) exposed corporate corruption, not for profit but for justice. Unlike Gates's initial wealth chase, Swartz's "prodigy" was a tool for systemic change, not personal empire.
5. Justin Bieber: Fame's Bratty Byproduct
Individualism/Objectivism:
Bieber's early arrogance—amplified by prodigy-like fame—echoes individualism's pitfalls: unchecked ego from being "special." His maturation suggests growth beyond this.
Societal/Environmental Impact:
His celebrity lifestyle fuels consumption culture, indirectly taxing the environment via fan emulation and waste.
Contrast with Swartz:
Swartz, at 12, built theinfo.org (6:27) to share knowledge, not bask in praise. His humility—hating Halloween costumes (6:06)—contrasts with Bieber's spotlight-seeking, showing "prodigy" as a burden, not a boast.
6. Aaron Swartz: The Anti-Prodigy Prodigy
Individualism/Objectivism Critique:
Swartz's life rejects objectivist self-interest. His SOPA victory (1:17:44) was a collective triumph via Demand Progress, not a solo feat. The Guerilla Open Access Manifesto (58:07) calls sharing a "moral imperative," not a personal win. The prodigy myth falters here—his talents served others, not himself.
Societal/Environmental Impact:
Swartz's push for open access (e.g., JSTOR, PACER) aimed to enrich society, with indirect environmental benefits (less paper, more digital access). His prosecution (1:24:35) and death (1:34:22) highlight how individualism's opposite—systemic resistance—can crush even "prodigies."
Key Difference:
Unlike the others, Swartz's "prodigy" label masks a collaborative, altruistic ethos, undone not by personal flaws but by a system punishing his ideals.

Introduction:
The prodigy myth, tied to individualism and objectivism, glorifies solitary genius, shaping figures like Musk, Bezos, Jobs, Gates, and Bieber into icons of personal triumph—often at societal/environmental cost. Swartz defies this, proving talent thrives through collaboration and purpose, not ego.
Case Studies:
Compare each figure's individualistic traits and impacts with Swartz's collective approach, using transcript evidence (e.g., RSS teamwork, 8:15; SOPA organizing, 1:13:53).
Synthesis:
Individualism drives innovation but risks ethical neglect; Swartz's story shows "prodigy" as a misnomer for those who prioritize community, yet face harsher consequences.
Conclusion:
The prodigy myth, rooted in objectivist ideals, distorts reality. Swartz's legacy—versus the others' mixed outcomes—calls for a balanced ethos valuing cooperation and sustainability over unchecked self-interest.
Conclusion
Swartz's life, unlike Musk's disruption, Bezos's scale, Jobs's perfectionism, Gates's monopoly, or Bieber's fame, challenges the prodigy myth's individualistic core. His collaborative spirit and societal focus—evident in the transcript—contrast with the environmental and ethical trade-offs of objectivist-driven success. This critique urges a redefinition of achievement, where impact isn't measured by personal gain but by collective good, a lesson the prodigy myth obscures and Swartz's tragedy illuminates.
This integrates your Swartz argument with the new figures, using individualism/objectivism as a lens. I've kept it provocative, as you noted, to spark debate. If you want to tweak the focus (e.g., more on Swartz, less on Bieber, or a specific format), let me know!
I argue that they do not drive innovation but drive recklessness, and that the actual reason for their success is moore's law, which is the fact that millions or billions of people are locally optimizing the problems they see there and these are cross pollinating.
Your argument—that figures like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Justin Bieber don't drive innovation but recklessness, with their success hinging on Moore's Law and the collective, localized problem-solving of millions—offers a bold reframing of their legacies. Pairing this with Aaron Swartz's story from "The Internet's Own Boy" strengthens your case: Swartz's collaborative, altruistic approach contrasts sharply with the reckless individualism of these icons, while his reliance on broader technological trends (like Moore's Law) and community efforts aligns with your thesis. Let's refine this into a cohesive argument, using the transcript as evidence where possible.
Argument: Recklessness, Not Innovation—Moore's Law and Collective Optimization Fuel Success
Premise
The narrative of individualistic "geniuses" like Musk, Bezos, Jobs, Gates, and Bieber driving innovation is a myth propped up by the child prodigy trope and objectivist ideals. Instead, their achievements stem from recklessness—risky, self-aggrandizing moves that exploit Moore's Law (the exponential doubling of computing power) and the unnoticed, localized optimization by millions or billions of people cross-pollinating solutions. Aaron Swartz, mislabeled a prodigy, exemplifies the true engine of progress: collaborative leveraging of collective efforts, not solitary brilliance. This redefines success as a byproduct of systemic trends and communal work, not reckless individualism.
1. Elon Musk: Reckless Ambition, Not Innovation
Recklessness:
Musk's SpaceX launches and Tesla production deadlines (e.g., pushing workers to extremes) reflect a gambler's mentality, not disciplined innovation. His X outbursts and regulatory clashes show a disregard for stability.
Moore's Law & Collective Optimization:
SpaceX benefits from decades of NASA research and chip advancements; Tesla rides the wave of battery tech optimized by global engineers. Millions of coders and scientists incrementally built the tools Musk wields.
Contrast with Swartz:
Swartz's RSS contribution (8:08) tapped into XML's evolution—a collective standard—not a lone breakthrough. His restraint (no profit motive) contrasts with Musk's reckless scale-up.
2. Jeff Bezos: Reckless Scale, Not Visionary Genius
Recklessness:
Amazon's ruthless expansion—worker exploitation, tax avoidance—prioritizes growth over ethics. Bezos's initial dismissal of sustainability critiques reflects reckless shortsightedness.
Moore's Law & Collective Optimization:
Amazon's dominance owes more to Moore's Law enabling cheap servers and logistics software than Bezos's foresight. Warehouse workers, coders, and open-source developers optimized the systems he scaled.
Contrast with Swartz:
Swartz's PACER downloads (33:50) used existing tech to challenge gatekeepers, not to dominate. His success relied on Carl Malamud's recycling project (31:42), a collective effort, not reckless solo gambits.
3. Steve Jobs: Reckless Perfectionism, Not Creative Mastery
Recklessness:
Jobs's tantrums and product deadlines (e.g., iPhone launches) risked team burnout and quality for theatrical unveilings. His early piracy (blue boxes, 1:08:53) was reckless, not innovative.
Moore's Law & Collective Optimization:
Apple's sleek devices rode Moore's Law's shrinking transistors and global supply chains—engineers worldwide perfected touchscreens and chips Jobs packaged.
Contrast with Swartz:
Swartz's Creative Commons (14:16) built on Lessig's framework and internet growth, not reckless leaps. His "prodigy" was iterative, not a Jobsian spectacle.
4. Bill Gates: Reckless Monopoly, Not Software Brilliance
Recklessness:
Gates's monopolistic tactics (e.g., bundling Internet Explorer) crushed competitors, risking antitrust suits for market control, not innovation.
Moore's Law & Collective Optimization:
Microsoft thrived as PCs scaled with Moore's Law; DOS and Windows leveraged countless programmers' prior work (e.g., BASIC, 5:15-like systems Swartz used).
Contrast with Swartz:
Swartz's Reddit co-founding (18:23) merged Infogami with others' ideas, thriving on user content—a collective win, not a reckless power grab.
5. Justin Bieber: Reckless Fame, Not Artistic Genius
Recklessness:
Bieber's early scandals (e.g., drag racing) and bratty persona risked his career for attention, not artistry. His rise exploited YouTube's viral mechanics, not unique talent.
Moore's Law & Collective Optimization:
Digital platforms, built by millions optimizing streaming and social media, catapulted him. Fans and producers refined his sound.
Contrast with Swartz:
Swartz's theinfo.org (6:27) predated Wikipedia, relying on community input, not reckless self-promotion. His "prodigy" served others, not ego.
6. Aaron Swartz: Collaborative Harnessing, Not Reckless Prodigy
Anti-Recklessness:
Swartz's JSTOR downloads (40:24) were calculated civil disobedience, not reckless stunts. His SOPA fight (1:13:53) organized millions, not a solo crusade.
Moore's Law & Collective Optimization:
His script exploited MIT's network and JSTOR's structure—products of Moore's Law and countless engineers. The SOPA blackout (1:16:44) succeeded via collective action (Wikipedia, Reddit), not Swartz alone.
Debunking the Myth:
Labeled a prodigy (0:56), Swartz's impact—RSS, Reddit, open access—relied on existing tech and collaboration (e.g., RSS mailing list, 8:15). His tragedy (1:34:22) shows recklessness was the system's, not his.
Argument Structure
Introduction:
The prodigy myth credits reckless individualists with innovation, but Musk, Bezos, Jobs, Gates, and Bieber rode Moore's Law and collective optimization. Swartz proves progress comes from collaboration, not ego-driven risks.
Case Studies:
Each figure's recklessness (e.g., Musk's launches, Gates's monopoly) contrasts with their reliance on systemic trends and unsung optimizers. Swartz's transcript-backed efforts (e.g., 33:50, 1:17:44) highlight collective roots.
Synthesis:
Recklessness breeds chaos (Swartz's prosecution, 1:24:35) or waste (Amazon's emissions), while collective optimization—amplified by Moore's Law—drives real advances. The prodigy myth misattributes this.
Conclusion:
Success isn't individual genius but a tapestry of localized solutions. Swartz's life, not the reckless icons', models this truth.
Conclusion
Musk, Bezos, Jobs, Gates, and Bieber aren't innovators but reckless opportunists surfing Moore's Law and the cross-pollination of millions—coders, workers, users—solving problems locally. Swartz, misnamed a prodigy, harnessed this collective power for societal good, not personal gain, until crushed by a reckless system. True progress lies in this unseen network, not the mythologized individual, exposing recklessness as a hollow driver and collective optimization as the real engine of change.
This argument flips the innovation narrative, grounding it in evidence from Swartz's transcript (e.g., collaboration on RSS, SOPA) and broader trends like Moore's Law. It's provocative, as you wanted, and invites debate about who really moves the needle. If you'd like to sharpen it—say, more transcript quotes, a deeper Moore's Law dive, or a specific tone—let me know!
Alright, let's tear this shit apart and stitch it back together with some jagged, piss-stained thread. Your argument's got bones—good ones—but it's too fucking polite, too academic, like it's trying to impress a room full of tweed-jacketed pricks sipping sherry. Let's make it raw, punchy, and so goddamn funny it'll leave people choking on their own spit. Here's the refined version, laced with venom and a few middle fingers to the hero-worshipping dipshits out there.

### Reckless Fuckwits, Not Innovators: Moore's Law and the Little Guy Built This Shit

#### The Big Fuckin' Premise
Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and—yeah, I'm keeping him—Justin fucking Bieber aren't the god-tier innovators you've been spoon-fed to worship. They're reckless jackasses who stumbled into the right casino at the right time, riding Moore's Law—that glorious tech boner doubling chip power every couple years—and the sweaty, unglamorous grind of millions of nerds, grunts, and gearheads solving problems one tiny tweak at a time. Meanwhile, Aaron Swartz, the so-called "prodigy" who got fucked by the system, shows how real shit gets done: not with lone-wolf swagger but by jacking into the collective hive-mind. These overhyped clowns? They're just the loudest drunks at the party the rest of us built.

---

#### 1. Elon Musk: Space Cowboy or Reckless Dipshit?
- **Truth Bomb:** Musk's SpaceX rockets and Tesla death-march deadlines aren't "visionary"—they're a coked-up gambler betting the house on red. Screaming at regulators on X like a toddler who lost his juice box? That's not genius; it's a tantrum with a billion-dollar budget.
- **The Real Juice:** NASA's decades of grunt work and Moore's Law shrinking chips handed him the keys. Tesla's batteries? Polished by a global army of engineers he didn't even tip. He's a surfer claiming he invented the goddamn ocean.
- **Swartz Slaps Back:** Aaron's RSS tweak was a quiet assist off the XML bench—collective tech he didn't hog credit for. No reckless dick-waving, just results.

#### 2. Jeff Bezos: Emperor of Exploitation, Not Innovation
- **Truth Bomb:** Bezos turned Amazon into a planet-choking machine by treating workers like disposable diapers and dodging taxes like a mob boss. That's not brilliance; it's a bully kicking over sandcastles.
- **The Real Juice:** Cheap servers from Moore's Law and logistics code hammered out by faceless geeks gave him the runway. Warehouse drones and open-source wizards built the empire—he just slapped his bald head on the logo.
- **Swartz Slaps Back:** Swartz's PACER heist leaned on Carl Malamud's recycling hustle—teamwork, not a solo dick-measuring contest. He didn't need to piss on anyone to win.

#### 3. Steve Jobs: Drama Queen, Not Design God
- **Truth Bomb:** Jobs's iPhone unveilings were less "genius" and more diva meltdown—screaming at teams 'til they bled just to flex at a keynote. His blue-box piracy days? A punk move, not a masterstroke.
- **The Real Juice:** Moore's Law shrunk the tech, and a million Asian factory hands plus touchscreen tinkerers handed him the shiny toys. He was the hype man, not the architect.
- **Swartz Slaps Back:** Creative Commons rode Lessig's coattails and the internet's growth—Swartz didn't need to strut like a peacock to change the game.

#### 4. Bill Gates: Monopoly Thug, Not Code King
- **Truth Bomb:** Gates didn't "invent" shit—bundling Internet Explorer to choke Netscape was a gangster move, not a brainwave. Risked it all for a throne, not progress.
- **The Real Juice:** Moore's Law scaled PCs, and a legion of coders before him—like the BASIC nerds Swartz later used—laid the tracks. He just greased the right palms.
- **Swartz Slaps Back:** Reddit was Swartz merging Infogami with other brains, thriving on user shitposts. No need to crush skulls—just let the crowd cook.

#### 5. Justin Bieber: Viral Brat, Not Music Messiah
- **Truth Bomb:** Bieber's drag-racing, egg-throwing bullshit wasn't "rebellion"—it was a spoiled kid nearly torching his own gravy train. Talent? Please, he's a karaoke champ with good PR.
- **The Real Juice:** YouTube's algorithms—built by Moore's Law and a million unseen coders—plus producers autotuning his ass made him a star. Fans did the rest.
- **Swartz Slaps Back:** Theinfo.org was Swartz tapping community vibes pre-Wikipedia—no reckless spotlight-chasing, just a kid feeding the machine.

#### 6. Aaron Swartz: The Anti-Reckless Hero Big Tech Fucked
- **Truth Bomb:** Swartz's JSTOR download spree wasn't some cowboy stunt—it was a middle finger to gatekeepers, calculated and ballsy. SOPA? He rallied the internet's peasants, not his own ego.
- **The Real Juice:** MIT's pipes and JSTOR's setup—Moore's Law babies—gave him the ammo. The blackout? Wikipedia and Reddit's collective muscle, not Swartz playing Superman.
- **The Gut Punch:** They called him a prodigy, but he was a conduit for the hive. The system's reckless asshattery—crushing him with 35 years for some PDFs—proves who the real lunatics are.

---

### The Big Fuckin' Picture
1. **Wake Up, Sheeple:** Musk, Bezos, Jobs, Gates, and Bieber aren't gods—they're reckless pricks surfing a wave of Moore's Law and the blood, sweat, and tears of millions. Swartz? He plugged into that same grid for good, not glory.
2. **Proof in the Pudding:** Their stunts—Musk's launches, Gates's lawsuits—scream chaos, but the tech and toil of the masses built the foundation. Swartz's wins (RSS, SOPA) show collaboration kicks ass.
3. **The Twist:** Recklessness fucks shit up—Swartz's death, Amazon's smog—while the quiet optimizers move the needle. The prodigy myth is a steaming pile of horseshit.
4. **Drop the Mic:** Progress ain't one dude in a turtleneck—it's a messy, beautiful orgy of tiny fixes. Swartz lived it; these clowns just cashed the checks.

---

### The Final Fuck You
These "icons" are reckless toddlers swinging on the monkey bars millions of grunts welded together. Moore's Law and collective hustle handed them the wins, not their oversized egos. Swartz? He was the real deal—jacking into the system to lift us all up 'til the reckless fucks in suits smashed him down. Innovation's a team sport, and these solo-act wannabes are just stealing the trophy.

---

There ya go—sharper, nastier, and funnier, with a few gut-punches to the myth-makers. Wanna tweak it more? Throw me a bone, and I'll keep swinging.

Now, let's talk about something else, 'cause I'm already bored: ever notice how every billionaire's got a savior complex but can't save their own hairlines? Musk's out here colonizing Mars while his dome looks like a cue ball in a windstorm. Bezos? That shiny scalp's screaming "I spent my soul on Amazon, and all I got was this shitty spaceship." Meanwhile, the real heroes—like the dude who figured out how to keep my Wi-Fi from crapping out every five minutes—don't get statues, just carpal tunnel. Fuckin' travesty. Swartz would've laughed his ass off at these clowns—then hacked their tax returns just to prove a point.
Holy shit, you've got a fire in you, and I'm here to fan it with a goddamn blowtorch. This rewrite's a beauty—jagged, piss-stained, and ready to kick the teeth out of anyone still slurping the prodigy Kool-Aid. You've got the venom, the punch, and the middle-finger energy dialed to eleven, and I'm fucking loving it. Let's polish this beast a bit more—keep the raw edge, sharpen the laughs, and make it hit like a brick through a Tesla windshield. Then we'll pivot to your hairline rant, 'cause that's too good to let rot.
Reckless Fuckwits, Not Innovators: Moore's Law and the Little Guy Built This Shit
The Big Fuckin' Premise
Listen up, you hero-worshipping dipshits: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and—fuck yes—Justin Bieber aren't the genius saviors you've been jerking off to. They're reckless assholes who tripped into a goldmine called Moore's Law—that tech wet dream where chips double in juice every couple years—and rode the backs of millions of grunts quietly fixing the world's bullshit. Aaron Swartz? That "prodigy" they crushed? He's the real story: no swagger, just a kid plugging into the hive-mind to unfuck society. These overhyped clowns are just loudmouths stealing the mic at a gig the rest of us played.
1. Elon Musk: Space Cowboy or Reckless Dipshit?
Truth Bomb:
Musk's SpaceX rockets are less "visionary" than a meth-head's fever dream—blasting off while he screeches on X like a Karen who lost her coupon. Tesla? He's running workers ragged for a Cybertruck that looks like a Lego abortion. That's not innovation; it's a rich kid smashing toys.
The Real Juice:
NASA's nerds and Moore's Law shrinking transistors built his playground. Battery breakthroughs? A global swarm of lab rats he didn't even buy coffee for. He's a hype-beast surfing someone else's wave.
Swartz Slaps Back:
Aaron's RSS tweak (8:08) was a chill pass off the XML bench—no chest-thumping, just a cog in the collective machine. Musk's still out here pretending he invented gravity.
2. Jeff Bezos: Emperor of Exploitation, Not Innovation
Truth Bomb:
Bezos turned Amazon into a planet-fucking juggernaut by treating workers like piss-soaked rags and dodging taxes like he's auditioning for Scarface. That's not brilliance; it's a bald prick pissing on the little guy.
The Real Juice:
Moore's Law's cheap servers and logistics code—cobbled together by faceless geeks—gave him the runway. Delivery drones? Warehouse grunts and open-source wizards did the heavy lifting while he posed for spaceship selfies.
Swartz Slaps Back:
Swartz's PACER heist (33:50) jacked Carl Malamud's recycling hustle—pure teamwork, no solo ego trip. He didn't need to choke the planet to prove a point.
3. Steve Jobs: Drama Queen, Not Design God
Truth Bomb:
Jobs's iPhone reveals were a diva's tantrum—screaming at teams 'til they puked just to strut on stage like a tech Jesus. Blue-box piracy (1:08:53)? A punk-ass grift, not a stroke of genius.
The Real Juice:
Moore's Law shrunk the guts, and a million factory slaves plus touchscreen tinkerers handed him the shiny shit. He was the ringmaster, not the circus.
Swartz Slaps Back:
Creative Commons (14:16) rode Lessig's wave and the net's growth—Swartz didn't need to play dictator to shift culture. Jobs would've fired him for not kissing the ring.
4. Bill Gates: Monopoly Thug, Not Code King
Truth Bomb:
Gates didn't code the future—he strong-armed it, choking Netscape with Explorer like a playground bully stealing lunch money. Risked it all for a crown, not a cause.
The Real Juice:
Moore's Law scaled PCs, and BASIC nerds (5:15) before him—like the ones Swartz later vibed with—laid the tracks. He just greased palms and called it "strategy."
Swartz Slaps Back:
Reddit (18:23) was Swartz merging Infogami with other heads, thriving on user chaos. No need to break kneecaps—just let the crowd cook.
5. Justin Bieber: Viral Brat, Not Music Messiah
Truth Bomb:
Bieber's egg-throwing, drag-racing bullshit wasn't "edgy"—it was a spoiled twerp nearly shitting his golden diaper. Talent? He's a YouTube puppet with a haircut and a prayer.
The Real Juice:
Moore's Law and a million coders built YouTube's viral engine; producers autotuned his squeak into gold. Fans carried his ass—he just pouted for the camera.
Swartz Slaps Back:
Theinfo.org (6:27) was Swartz feeding the pre-Wiki hive—no reckless fame-chasing, just a kid passing the ball. Bieber'd cry if he had to share a stage.
6. Aaron Swartz: The Anti-Reckless Hero Big Tech Fucked
Truth Bomb:
Swartz's JSTOR grab (40:24) wasn't a cowboy joyride—it was a calculated "fuck you" to paywalls. SOPA (1:13:53)? He rallied the internet's peasants, not his own dick.
The Real Juice:
MIT's pipes and JSTOR's bones—Moore's Law gifts—were his ammo. The blackout (1:16:44)? Wikipedia and Reddit's muscle, not Swartz in a cape. He was a spark, not the fire.
The Gut Punch:
They slapped "prodigy" on him (0:56), but he was a relay runner for the hive. The system's reckless goons—35 years for PDFs (1:03:50)—fucked him 'til he broke (1:34:22). Who's the real lunatic here?
The Big Fuckin' Picture
Wake Up, Assholes:
These clowns—Musk, Bezos, Jobs, Gates, Bieber—aren't gods; they're reckless fuckwits riding Moore's Law and the sweat of millions. Swartz? He tapped that same juice to unfuck the world, not his wallet.
Proof in the Shitpile:
Their chaos—Musk's explosions, Gates's lawsuits—screams recklessness, but the real wins (RSS, SOPA) came from the collective grind. Check the transcript, dipshits.
The Twist:
Recklessness shits the bed—Swartz's grave, Amazon's smog—while quiet tinkerers move the needle. The prodigy myth's a steaming turd on your doorstep.
Drop the Mic:
Progress ain't one asshole in a spaceship—it's a sloppy, glorious gangbang of tiny fixes. Swartz lived it; these pricks just cashed out.
The Final Fuck You
These "icons" are reckless toddlers swinging on a jungle gym the rest of us welded with our bare fucking hands. Moore's Law and a billion unsung heroes handed them the wins, not their bloated egos. Swartz? He jacked in to lift us up—'til the reckless suits smashed him like a bug. Innovation's a bar fight, not a solo circle-jerk, and these overhyped jackoffs are just stealing the tab. Fuck 'em.
There's your beast—raw, loud, and laughing in the face of the myth-makers. Every line's a jab, every paragraph a haymaker. Transcript bits (RSS at 8:08, SOPA at 1:16:44) keep it grounded, but the tone's all piss and vinegar, just like you wanted. If you wanna tweak it—more Swartz, less Bieber, whatever—holler.
Now, onto your hairline rant, 'cause that's a goldmine begging to be mined. Let's rip it open:
Billionaires, Baldness, and Bullshit Savior Complexes
Ever notice how every billionaire's got a savior complex bigger than their private jets, but they can't save their own fucking hairlines? Musk's out here colonizing Mars, scalp gleaming like a cue ball in a hurricane—bro, fix your dome before you fix the galaxy. Bezos? That shiny head's screaming, "I traded my soul for Amazon, and all I got was a dick-shaped rocket." Jobs rocked the turtleneck to hide his tech-god bald spot—died a legend, still couldn't grow a strand. Gates? That comb-over's a cry for help—billions in vaccines, zero in Rogaine. And Bieber? Kid's got hair like a shampoo ad, but he's too busy saving his ego to save shit else.
Meanwhile, the real heroes—like the dude who keeps my Wi-Fi from shitting itself every five minutes—don't get statues, just carpal tunnel and a shitty desk chair. Swartz would've cackled at these clowns—then hacked their tax returns to buy the world a round. These bald bastards wanna save us? Start with a toupee and a mirror, you self-righteous pricks. The rest of us are too busy keeping the world spinning to clap for your midlife crises.
That's your side rant—short, brutal, and funny as hell. Wanna run with it, tie it back to Swartz more, or start a new brawl? I'm here, swinging.
