Here are a few ways to think about it:


---

1. App Ecosystem Perspective
Modern apps often incorporate an internal browser to keep users within a controlled environment. When you click a hyperlink, the app opens it in its own mini-browser rather than handing off the link to an external browser. This design helps maintain a consistent user interface, security, and engagement within the app's ecosystem—even if it means losing the "seamless" navigation that Xanadu's vision of traversable backlinks would offer.


---

2. User Experience Perspective
From a user experience point of view, embedding hyperlinks inside an internal browser can be seen as a way to prevent disruptive context switches. Instead of leaving the app entirely, you get a version of Wikipedia running within the app. However, this approach isn't quite what Project Xanadu envisioned. Xanadu aimed for bidirectional links where you could easily jump to related content and then just as easily return to your original context, preserving the relationship between the two. What you're seeing is a trade-off: the app prioritizes consistency and control over the richer, more context-aware linking model.

3. Hypermedia vs. Xanadu Philosophy
Project Xanadu's idea of traversable backlinks was to create a truly interconnected web of content—where every link maintained its context, allowing you to navigate both forward and backward seamlessly. In contrast, the design you described—where a hyperlink opens a new internal view—reflects a more modern, compartmentalized approach. Rather than maintaining a two-way, context-preserving link, the app isolates the linked content in its own "bubble." This method is common today, but it's a departure from the holistic, context-rich experience that Xanadu intended.

In essence, while the behavior of your app is a common design choice for modern apps, it does differ from the traversable, context-preserving linking envisioned by Project Xanadu.

Oh, man, you just dropped a nerd-bomb about app ecosystems and Project Xanadu like it's a TED Talk for hypertext fetishists! I love it—let's rip this apart. So, apps these days are like clingy exes who don't want you leaving their shitty little world, right? They trap you in their janky in-app browsers because God forbid you experience the raw, unfiltered chaos of Chrome or Firefox. It's like, "Nah, stay in my walled garden, buddy, where I can track your every click and serve you ads for dick pills." Meanwhile, Xanadu's out here dreaming of a utopia where links are like wormholes—zipping you back and forth through knowledge with context so tight you'd never get lost. Too bad we traded that for apps that treat hyperlinks like a one-way ticket to their shitty sandbox.
And don't get me started on "user experience." UX designers act like they're saving you from a nervous breakdown by keeping you in their app, but it's just a fancy excuse for control. They're not preserving context—they're preserving their revenue stream! Xanadu's like, "Yo, let's make information a free-flowing orgy of ideas," and modern apps are like, "Nah, you're gonna stay in my shitty pop-up window and like it." It's the difference between a library and a casino—one wants you to explore, the other wants you glued to the slot machine.
Now, let's talk about this whole in-app browser nonsense. It's like apps are saying, "I don't trust the internet to not fuck up my vibe." They're terrified you'll see a real browser and realize their app is just a glorified webpage with worse navigation. And the irony? These same apps will crash if you sneeze too hard, but sure, let's pretend they're the gold standard of "seamless." Xanadu's bidirectional links would've been like GPS for your brain, but instead, we got apps that treat every link like a dead-end alley. Thanks, Silicon Valley.

: You know what grinds my gears? The whole tech industry's obsession with "ecosystems" is just a polite way of saying "we own your ass." They're not building tools—they're building cages. Every app wants to be your mom, your priest, and your parole officer, all while pretending it's for your own good. And don't even get me started on how they've turned the internet into a strip mall. Back in the day, the web was a wild west of weird Geocities pages and unhinged forums. Now it's just five corporations jerking each other off while we're forced to pick which one gets to spy on us. Xanadu had it right—let ideas fuck freely, no gatekeepers. But nah, we chose the timeline where every click's a loyalty test. Screw that noise—give me a web where I can surf like a maniac and not end up in some app's creepy basement!
