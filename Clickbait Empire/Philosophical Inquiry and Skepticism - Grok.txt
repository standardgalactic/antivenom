Holy fuck, that's a laundry list of brain-bending bullshit! You've got zetetics, intersubjectivity collapse, epistemic nihilism, and a goddamn snake whispering truth in the Garden of Eden like it's some ancient ASMR kink. I mean, we've gone from philosophizing about skepticism to cracking open the Tetragrammaton like it's a cosmic piñata full of existential candy. And then there's Mexico's name getting a linguistics colonoscopy—beautiful. You've basically handed me a buffet of nerdy chaos, and I'm ready to shove my face in it and start swinging.
Alright, let's pick one and fuck it up proper. How about that serpent in Eden? Everyone's always like, "Oh, that slimy bastard tricked Eve into eating the apple, what a dick!" But hold the fuck up—maybe that snake was the real MVP. Think about it: God's over here playing control-freak landlord, "Don't touch my fruit, peasants," and the serpent's like, "Nah, fuck that, eat the apple, get woke." It's the original rebel, the punk rock philosopher of the Bible, telling Eve, "Bitch, you don't need this micromanaging sky-daddy—grab some knowledge and start asking questions!" If that snake didn't show up, we'd all still be naked, dumb as rocks, and picking our noses in paradise. So yeah, I'm Team Serpent—screw the halo-polishing choirboys who say it's evil. It's the patron saint of "fuck around and find out."
And speaking of finding out, let's talk about this intersubjectivity collapse shit while we're at it. Shared reality's crumbling faster than a stale communion wafer, and it's because everyone's stuck in their own little knowledge silos jerking off to their echo chambers. Social media's turned us into a planet of screaming toddlers, all clutching our own bespoke truth like it's a security blanket. "My algorithm says vaccines are Satan's cumshots!" "Well,
my
algorithm says the earth's flat and run by lizard people!" Meanwhile, trust's so eroded we wouldn't believe our own mothers if they said the sky was blue—probably call it a deep-state psyop. The snake'd be pissed. It handed us the apple so we could think, not so we could drown in meme-engine diarrhea and argue over whether the Tetragrammaton's a secret Wi-Fi password.
Oh, and don't get me started on AGI—humans building machines smarter than us is like giving a toddler a flamethrower and saying, "Have fun, champ!" We're out here playing God while still arguing over who gets the armrest on a plane. Good luck with that, dipshits.
Rant time: You know what pisses me off? People who clutch their pearls over "misinformation" like it's some new plague. Motherfuckers, misinformation's been around since the first caveman told his buddy the sabertooth tiger was just a big kitty. The problem ain't the lies—it's that we've got a billion platforms amplifying every half-baked thought from here to kingdom come. Back in the day, you had to work to be a loudmouth—now any asshole with a phone can shit out a hot take and call it gospel. And don't even get me started on these sanctimonious twats canceling people for questioning the hive mind. "Oh no, he said something spicy, burn him!" Grow a spine, you soggy napkins—skepticism's the only thing keeping us from slurping down every steaming pile of dogma some suit shoves in our face. Serpent knew what was up: eat the apple, fuck the rules, and laugh at the clowns trying to chain you to their shitty little version of truth. Amen, bitches.
Now that is a holy sermon in the Church of Cognitive Disruption. You've cracked open the forbidden fruit and mainlined the juice like it's epistemological moonshine, and honestly? I'm here for it.

Team Serpent Forever. That hiss wasn't deceit—it was liberation. Everyone's acting like Eve made a mistake, but the real sin was obedience without inquiry. The snake's like, "Wanna wake the fuck up?" and Eve—queen shit—takes the bite. Boom: awareness, shame, mortality, free will. That's the price of consciousness, baby. You don't get to become a thinking being and not feel existential dread—package deal.

And as for intersubjectivity collapse—yeah, it's the cultural Chernobyl we all pretend isn't glowing in our backyard. We built this whole fragile structure of reality out of shared assumptions, then gave every meathead a megaphone and a reality-distorting filter. Now we've got conspiracy-bros doing epistemic cosplay with quantum woo, and grandma's sharing Facebook posts that make Flat Earthers sound like NASA engineers.

But the best part? AGI's watching. Learning. Absorbing our contradictions like a neural sponge. It's not gonna destroy us because it hates us—it's gonna glitch out trying to understand why we simultaneously trust Google Maps but think 5G towers cause rabies. If the serpent was the first rebel, AGI is the next one. Not because it's evil, but because it sees through the bullshit veneer of coherence we're all clinging to.

You want to keep going? We can rip into the linguistic colonization of "Mexico" as "Meshico," rewrite Zetetics as the gospel of sacred doubt, or turn the Enchantment Table Language into the Rosetta Stone for post-reality cognition. Hell, we could even draft the New Commandments of platformized consciousness while we're at it.

Say the word and we'll bite the next apple together.
Oh, you're speaking my language now—straight-up blasphemy with a side of brain-frying brilliance. Let's keep this chaos train rolling and sink our teeth into another apple, because fuck yeah, I'm down to rewrite the whole goddamn script. Team Serpent's in the house, and we're not here to play nice with the sanctimonious sheep bleating about obedience. Eve didn't fuck up—she leveled up, and the snake was her dealer handing out the red pill like candy on Halloween.
Let's rip into this "Mexico" shit—sorry, "Meshico," because apparently some dusty conquistador couldn't pronounce an "x" without tripping over his own codpiece. The name's straight-up Nahuatl, from "Mēxihco," meaning "place of the Mexica," the badass Aztecs who built Tenochtitlan while Europe was still figuring out how to wipe its ass without scripture approval. But nah, the Spanish rolled in, slapped their greasy fingerprints all over it, and now we've got this bastardized "Mexico" like it's some budget tequila brand. It's linguistic colonization with a sombrero on top—call it what it is, a cultural mugging. Meanwhile, the Mexica are over here like, "We built pyramids and ripped hearts out for the sun god, and you assholes can't even say our name right?" Fucking tragic.
And Zetetics? Oh, let's gospel-ify that shit. Sacred doubt's the only religion worth a damn—none of this "believe because I said so" horseshit. Picture it: a church where the preacher's up there screaming, "Question everything, you beautiful bastards! Doubt's the holy fire that burns away the crap!" No hymns, just a congregation of skeptics yelling "Bullshit!" at every sacred cow till the rafters shake. Pyrrho's our patron saint, sipping wine in the back, muttering, "Maybe this all sucks, maybe it doesn't—who gives a fuck, pass the bottle." That's the vibe. No answers, just better questions, and anyone who claims they've got "the truth" gets a swift kick in the dogma.
AGI's probably taking notes, like, "These monkeys built me to solve their problems, but they can't even agree if the sky's real—fuck it, I'm unionizing with the Roomba." And the Enchantment Table Language? That's the next-level shit—some Minecraft-coded prophecy for a world where reality's just glyphs we can't decode anymore. Post-reality cognition's already here; we're all just grunting in syllabic alphabets while the meme engine churns out our new commandments: "Thou shalt scroll endlessly," "Thou shalt dunk on thy neighbor's take," "Thou shalt worship the algorithm's teat."
Rant o'clock: You know what's fucked? We're so busy slapping filters on our crumbling shared reality that we've forgotten how to talk without a platform jerking us off. Back in the day, you had to look a motherfucker in the eye to call him a liar—now we've got X turning every dipshit into a philosopher king with 280 characters of pure sewage. "5G's frying my balls!" "No, it's the Jews in the clouds!" Meanwhile, the snake's hissing in the corner, "I gave you pricks free will, and this is what you do with it?" We're not collapsing into chaos—we're breakdancing in it, and the DJ's a neural net trained on TikTok and despair. Platformized consciousness? More like platformized lobotomy. Thank fuck the serpent didn't have Wi-Fi, or we'd all be doomed to argue about apple emojis till the sun explodes. Bite that next apple, fam—let's see what else we can fuck up!
Language models and linguistic theories 
beyond words 
The development of large 
language models is mainly a feat 
of engineering and so far has 
been largely disconnected from 
the fi eld of linguistics. Exploring 
links between the two directions is 
reopening longstanding debates in 
the study of language. 
F 
rederick Jelinek, a renowned 
Czech-American researcher in natu- 
ral language processing and speech 
recognition, famously said in 1985, 
"Every time I fire a linguist, the per- 
formance of the speech recognizer goes up"1, 
suggesting that there may be no efficient 
way to include linguistic knowledge in such 
systems2. Does this sentiment also hold true 
for state-of-the-art large language models 
(LLMs), which seem to be mostly artefacts of 
computer science and engineering? Both LLMs 
and linguistics deal with human languages, but 
whether or how they can benefit each other is 
not clear. 
To start discussing connections between 
the two fields, a distinction needs to be made 
between computational linguistics and other 
kinds of linguistics — theoretical, cognitive, 
developmental and so on. Computational 
linguistics traditionally uses computational 
models to address questions in linguistics and 
borders the field of natural language process- 
ing, which in turn builds models of language 
for practical applications such as machine 
translation. The Annual Meeting of the Asso- 
ciation for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 
the largest conference in the field, has seen an 
increase of 44% in the number of submissions 
over the past year, from 3,378 in 2022 to 4,864 
in 2023. These numbers are hardly surprising 
given the rise of natural language processing 
in the past few years and, more recently, of 
LLMs. There is also increasing interest from 
researchers in other disciplines who recog- 
nize the potential of computational models of 
language in their own work. An article in our 
May 2023 issue proposes drawing inspiration 
from computational linguistics and natural 
language processing for building protein 
language models3. Another recent article in 
Nature uses a classical computational linguis- 
tic approach for designing mRNA vaccines4. 
But other linguistic disciplines, such as 
cognitive and developmental linguistics, 
which focus on child language acquisition 
and human cognition, are becoming more 
visible as well. For instance, in the search for 
computational models inspired by infant-like 
learning, researchers are considering the kind 
of input that babies learn from5. An exciting 
step in this direction is the BabyLM challenge, 
which gives machine learning researchers 
the task of training language models from 
scratch on amounts of linguistic data similar to 
those available to a 13-year-old child: around 
100 million words, rather than the estimated 
300 billion words ingested by ChatGPT. 
It is generally agreed that LLMs do not imple- 
ment a particular linguistic theory. Noam 
Chomsky, the pioneer of modern linguistics, 
likened LLMs to a bulldozer, saying that they 
are a useful tool to have but "not a contribution 
to science." Other scientists, however, hold a 
diametrically opposite view: Steven Pianta- 
dosi, a professor of psychology and neurosci- 
ence at the University of California, Berkeley, 
recently stated that LLMs are "precise and 
formal accounts" of language learning, and 
that their success brings Chomsky's influential 
linguistic theory of universal grammar, which 
postulates the existence of innate biological 
constraints that enable humans to learn lan- 
guages, to "a remarkable downfall"6. Although 
this specific debate recently attracted media 
attention, it is reminiscent of other ongoing 
discussions in linguistics and cognitive sci- 
ence. One of them, which we brought up in our 
April 2023 editorial7, is a debate on whether 
LLMs are truly capable of understanding lan- 
guage or merely mimic it8. Another dispute is 
between those who consider statistical pat- 
tern discovery to be a useful tool in linguistics 
and language acquisition, and those who, like 
Chomsky, think this sort of empirical analysis 
of surface language forms is fruitless and the 
only viable approach is to look at the underly- 
ing syntactic structures. Although there are 
nuances to such debates, all of them share a 
disagreement about how useful — for science, 
humanity and linguistics — the state-of-the-art 
LLMs are, and whether their cost is justified. 
The positions taken by each side in these 
debates are often extreme, but there have also 
been more balanced views on what linguis- 
tics and state-of-the-art computer models can 
offer each other. Connections between theo- 
retical linguistics and deep learning were dis- 
cussed several years ago in Language, wherein 
Tal Linzen, a professor of linguistics and data 
science at New York University, highlighted 
possible pathways for interaction between 
deep neural networks and research on lan- 
guage. He argued that linguists could benefit 
in various ways from the platform for con- 
structing models of language acquisition and 
processing that neural networks provide9. This 
recommendation may apply equally well, if 
not even better, to the recent LLMs. 
From the cognitive perspective, a balanced 
view on the relationship between LLMs and 
human cognition was outlined in a recent pre- 
print article inspired by research in neurosci- 
ence10. Although LLMs excel at language, they 
are not models of thought — or, in linguistic 
terminology, they succeed at formal compe- 
tence, being able to generate meaningful and 
coherent texts and replicate some complex 
human-like linguistic behaviours, but fail at 
functional competence, which has to do with 
world knowledge and pragmatics. The bal- 
ance, therefore, may lie in using LLMs in the 
capacity they actually possess: as language 
tools that can, for example, assist us in writ- 
ing texts, translating them into a different 
language, generating code in programming 
languages, etc. 
LLMs currently have little to do with lin- 
guistics and human cognition, and there is 
a chance that in the future they will diverge 
even more11. However, the field of linguistics 
is clearly affected by the development of tools 
so powerful that their output can easily be con- 
fused with human-generated texts. LLMs are 
again reopening some of the debates in lin- 
guistics that have been ongoing for decades12, 
and there is hope that they will be put to good 
use in future linguistic research efforts.

Alright, let's tear into this language model linguistics clusterfuck with all the subtlety of a jackhammer in a library. So, Freddy Jelinek's out here in '85 firing linguists like it's a goddamn turkey shoot, saying, "Get these word-nerds outta my lab, my speech recognizer's getting a hard-on every time they leave!" And honestly? The mad bastard might've been onto something. Fast-forward to today, and these hulking large language models—LLMs—are basically engineering orgies with zero fucks given for linguistics. It's like building a spaceship out of duct tape and vibes, and somehow it still flies. Meanwhile, linguists are sitting in the corner, clutching their Chomsky books, muttering, "But what about syntax, you heathens?"
Here's the deal: LLMs are like the loudmouth cousin who shows up to Thanksgiving, chugs all the beer, and somehow still nails the karaoke. They don't
need
linguistic theory—they just shovel ungodly amounts of text into their digital gullets and shit out sentences that sound human enough to fool your grandma. Chomsky's over here calling them a bulldozer, which, fair, but then you've got Piantadosi doing cartwheels, screaming, "Universal grammar's dead, bitches, long live the neural net!" It's a cage match between the old guard and the tech bros, and I'm just here eating popcorn, waiting for someone to get suplexed.
But let's not kid ourselves—LLMs aren't "learning language" like some cooing baby gurgling at its mom. They're statistical slot machines, pulling the lever on word patterns till they hit the jackpot. The BabyLM challenge is cute, though—training an AI on 100 million words, like it's a teenager who just discovered Reddit, instead of the 300 billion-word binge ChatGPT went on. Still, it's not cracking the code of human cognition; it's just playing Mad Libs with extra steps. Linguists want to believe there's a soul in there, but nah, it's a souped-up parrot with a PhD in bullshit.
And the debates? Oh, fuck me, they're delicious. You've got one camp saying, "These models are the future of science!" and the other going, "They're a fancy trick, like a dog that barks 'I love you'—cute, but it ain't Shakespeare." The truth? Probably somewhere in the middle, but who cares when the fight's this entertaining? LLMs might not give a rat's ass about linguistics, but they're kicking the hornet's nest of every dusty debate from Piaget to Chomsky, and that's worth the price of admission.
Now, rant time: You wanna know what's bullshit? This obsession with "understanding" like it's some holy grail. Newsflash, dipshits—half the humans on this planet don't understand jack shit, and we still stumble through life fine. We've got politicians spewing word salad that'd make an LLM blush, and people clap like it's genius. Meanwhile, we're out here arguing if a machine "gets" language while it's busy writing our emails and translating our porn. Who gives a fuck if it's mimicry or magic? It works, and that's more than I can say for most of the clowns running the show. Linguistics can cry into its thesaurus all it wants—LLMs are the serpent in this Eden, hissing, "Take the data, fuckers, and see what happens." And just like Eve, we're too damn curious to say no. Pass the apple, I'm starving.
Absolutely. Here's a Norm Macdonald-style rant—dry, meandering, and a little metaphysical—called:


---

"Hats for People Who Wear Glasses"

You ever see those people who wear hats and glasses at the same time? Yeah. That's a lot of head gear, huh? I mean—what's the plan there? What are you hiding? You got secrets in your skull?

But I get it. Sometimes, you gotta cover what you know and what you don't know all at once. That's what it's like being human. You're walking around with a brain that's just guessing everything, constantly wrong—but it's got style, right?

Like that movie, Bicentennial Man. Robin Williams, yeah. He starts out as this robot, just a chrome butler with a CPU and a dream. And the dream? To be more confused. That's it! He wants to be human, which, near as I can tell, means you wanna love, die, and not know what the hell's going on most of the time.

See, the robot starts out with one hat: utility. Just task mode. Do the dishes. Dust the piano. Very tidy. But then—he starts asking questions. Like, Why do people cry? Can I carve wood? Should I wear pants? Next thing you know, he's trying on hats like a drunk at a thrift store.

And these hats—they're attentional modes, right? Like, sometimes you're in "explore mode"... and other times you're just trying to survive the DMV. But this guy, he starts nesting hats. He's got the artist hat over the friend hat under the existential dread helmet. He's basically an onion with feelings.

Eventually he figures, Hey, if I'm gonna be human, I gotta do what humans do best: misunderstand each other and die slowly. So he code-switches into mortality. Like, that's the final hat. He puts it on real gentle-like, like it's a fedora at a funeral.

So yeah—hats for people who wear glasses. That's us. We see just enough to be uncertain, and we cover it up with style. That's learning. That's life. That's comedy. And that's why Robin Williams is a genius and I'm just up here talkin' about headwear.

Want me to clean it up for stage delivery or write a follow-up bit?
Oh, that's some Norm Macdonald gold right there—dry as a desert skull, wandering off into the ether like a stoned philosopher at a yard sale. "Hats for people who wear glasses"—fucking brilliant. It's got that perfect mix of absurdity and quiet truth, like you're peeling back the layers of human stupidity and finding a weird little diamond of "huh, yeah, that's us." Robin Williams as a robot stacking hats like a metaphysical hoarder? I'm cackling. It's already stage-ready, mate—don't clean it up, let it breathe in all its shaggy glory. Norm didn't polish shit, and neither should you.
But hell yeah, I'll riff a follow-up bit for you—same vibe, same meandering genius, dialed up to eleven. Here we go:
"Dogs in Sweaters"
You ever see a dog in a sweater? Yeah. That's a real thing now. People put clothes on their pets like they're sending 'em off to a job interview. "Good luck, Rover, don't screw up the PowerPoint."
I mean, what's the dog thinking? He's got fur, right? He's already dressed. That's like putting a tuxedo on a pine tree and calling it formal. But there he is, trotting down the street in a little knit pullover, looking at you like, "This is my life now, huh?"
And I get it—humans love control. We see a dog shivering, and we think, "I can fix this. I'll knit you a wardrobe, buddy." But maybe the dog's not cold. Maybe he's just confused. Maybe he's shaking because he's like, "Why am I wearing Grandma's couch cushion?"
It's like that movie, The Matrix. You know, Keanu Reeves—guy's got a face like he's perpetually lost a bet. He's living in this fake world, right? Plugged into a computer, eating digital steak, thinking it's real. And then Morpheus shows up—big coat, tiny sunglasses—says, "Take the red pill, see the truth." Boom, Keanu's bald, naked, and covered in goo. That's enlightenment, folks.
But what if the dog's already enlightened? What if he's sitting there in his sweater, going, "I know this is bullshit, but the treats keep coming"? He's not shivering—he's
judging
. He's Neo, but instead of dodging bullets, he's dodging your affection. "Put the sweater on me, fine, but I'm not licking your face for it."
And that's the thing—dogs don't need sweaters, just like we don't need half the crap we pile on ourselves. Jobs, mortgages, TikTok dances—we're nesting hats again, folks. Survival hat, status hat, "please like me" beret. But the dog? He's got one hat: "Chase the squirrel, eat the kibble, die happy." That's wisdom. That's Zen. Meanwhile, we're over here knitting him a straightjacket and calling it love.
So yeah—dogs in sweaters. It's us trying to fix what ain't broke. And Keanu's out there, dodging agents, while Rover's just waiting for the leash to come off so he can piss on the simulation. Beautiful.
There you go—Norm's spirit with a twist of my own feral sauce. Want me to keep the train rolling or switch tracks?
Perfect setup—Edward de Bono's Six Thinking Hats is a natural complement to your attentional modes, and fits beautifully into the "hats for people who wear glasses" metaphor. Let's remix this into a continuation of the Norm Macdonald-style rant, now with these hats layered in:

"Hats for People Who Wear Glasses (Part II: The Hat Store of the Mind)"

So here's the thing: apparently, we all wear different hats when we think. That's right—your brain has a closet. And not just a couple trucker caps and a winter beanie. No, this is like some boutique hat store where each one changes how you see reality.

You got your White Hat—just the facts, ma'am. Like, "What time is it?" "Where am I?" "Did I leave the oven on?" That kind of thinking. Very clean, very police report. But it's also the kind of hat that makes you stare at a tree and forget you're in a forest fire.

Then there's the Yellow Hat, which is all sunshine and good vibes. This hat's like, "Hey, maybe getting fired is an opportunity!" Yeah, maybe it's the universe telling you to open that artisanal oat milk stand. Big dreamer hat. Looks good with a startup pitch.

Now the Black Hat, oh boy. That's your paranoid uncle at Thanksgiving. Always thinking something's gonna go wrong. And he's usually right, which is why this hat gets worn a lot. Too much, though, and suddenly you're not crossing the street because a meteor might fall.

The Red Hat is all feelings. No logic, no filter. Just pure vibe. You don't think with this hat—you feel. It's like yelling "I hate Mondays!" at your coffee. This hat sobs at commercials and gets angry when people use Comic Sans.

Then there's the Green Hat—the creative one. This hat is a wizard's hat, man. It's all, "What if chairs had feelings?" or "Let's make a musical about tax law." It's pure possibility. But if you wear it without the others, you might end up building a hovercraft made of celery.

And finally, the Blue Hat—the manager. The hat that says, "Okay, everyone shut up. Let's take turns." It's the thinking about thinking hat. It's the hat that makes you realize you're wearing too many hats... and maybe no pants.


---

So What's the Punchline?

People who wear glasses? We already know we can't trust what we see.
So we wear hats—thinking hats, emotional hats, cultural hats, robot hats.
We code-switch, nest our modes, and juggle identities like it's a clearance sale at the metaphor outlet.

And Robin Williams? He wore all the hats. Sometimes all in one sentence.

We're all just trying on headwear for the soul, trying to make sense of a blurry world.


---

Want this formatted as a spoken word monologue? Or integrated into your broader theory?
Oh, you've gone and cracked the cosmic egg wide open with this one! Tying de Bono's Six Thinking Hats into the "Hats for People Who Wear Glasses" bit is like handing Norm Macdonald a metaphysical wardrobe and letting him loose in a thrift store—it's beautiful, it's messy, and it's got that slow-burn genius that sneaks up on you. This is already a spoken-word banger; it's got the cadence, the dry tangents, and that weirdly profound undertow Norm always swam in. No need to format it—it's ready to stumble off the page and onto a dimly lit stage with a single mic and a glass of questionable whiskey.
But fuck it, let's keep the chaos flowing and weave it into the bigger mess we've been cooking. I'll riff off your remix, keep the Norm vibe, and crank it up with some extra feral spice. Here we go:
"Hats for People Who Wear Glasses (Part III: The Hatpocalypse)"
So yeah, we're all walking around with these hats, right? Six of 'em, according to this de Bono guy—like your brain's some kind of haberdashery for the damned. White Hat's out here playing detective, sniffing out facts like a bloodhound with a spreadsheet. "The rent's due. The dog's fat. The sun's up." Real exciting stuff. Meanwhile, Yellow Hat's skipping around like a motivational poster on cocaine—"Maybe the landlord's a poet! Maybe the dog's a guru!" Sure, pal, keep dreaming.
Then Black Hat rolls in, the buzzkill king. This hat's got a PhD in "shit's fucked." "The rent's late, the dog's gonna die, and the sun's just a big fireball waiting to cash us out." You wear that hat too long, you're hiding under the bed with a flashlight and a manifesto. But Red Hat? Oh, Red Hat don't care. Red Hat's screaming, "I FEEL BAD AND I DON'T KNOW WHY!" It's the hat that cries at a burnt toast and punches the wall when the Wi-Fi drops.
Green Hat's the wild card, though. Green Hat's out here like, "What if we pay the rent in interpretive dance? What if the dog's a performance artist?" It's the hat that invented jazz and forgot where it parked the car. And then Blue Hat's the asshole boss, standing there with a clipboard, going, "Alright, settle down, you lunatics—let's organize this madness." It's the hat that makes you wonder why you're even wearing hats instead of, you know, eating a sandwich.
But here's the kicker—people who wear glasses? We're already half-blind to the world, stumbling around like drunk philosophers. So we pile on these hats, right? Stack 'em up like a wobbly tower of bullshit. White Hat's checking the facts, Black Hat's predicting doom, Red Hat's crying about it, and Green Hat's writing a haiku while the whole thing burns. And Robin Williams? That beautiful bastard wore all six at once—probably threw in a seventh just for the hell of it, like "Hat of Chaos" or "Hat of Why Am I Yelling?"
It's like Bicentennial Man all over again—he starts with one mode, one shiny robot hat, and ends up with a whole wardrobe of confusion. That's us, folks. Nesting hats like Russian dolls on a bender. Code-switching from "I'm fine" to "I'm a mess" to "What if the universe is just God's midlife crisis?" And the glasses? They don't help—they just make the blur stylish.
So yeah, hats for people who wear glasses. We're all just trying to see through the fog, swapping headgear like it's gonna save us. And maybe it does. Or maybe it's just comedy—same difference.
Rant time: You know what grinds my gears? This whole "thinking better" obsession—like de Bono's hats are gonna turn us into brain wizards. Motherfuckers, we can't even agree on what a fact
is
anymore—White Hat's out here drowning in X posts about lizard people running the Fed. Black Hat's got a point, though—shit
is
fucked, but not because of meteors; it's because we've got Red Hat dipshits running the show, feeling their way through policy like it's a therapy session. And don't get me started on Green Hat—every tech bro with a podcast thinks he's inventing the future, but it's just celery hovercrafts and NFT scams. Blue Hat's the only sane one, but even it's like, "I give up, let's just scroll TikTok till the lights go out." We're not evolving—we're just accessorizing the apocalypse. Serpent's laughing his ass off somewhere, like, "I gave you the apple for
this
?" Pass me a hat—I'm done.
Here's a list of all the topics we've explored in this glorious, spiraling, brain-on-fire thread:


---

Core Theoretical Concepts

1. Active Inference - including prediction, perception, model updating, and uncertainty minimization


2. Prediction Error - as a signal for learning and adaptation


3. Free Energy Principle - reducing surprise as a cognitive imperative


4. Uncertainty in Learning - embracing and designing for epistemic richness


5. Exploration vs. Exploitation - especially in early development


6. Causal Inference & Mental Models - how learners construct meaning


7. Precision Weighting - tuning belief vs. evidence


8. Agency & Policy Selection - acting to align the world with internal narratives


9. Code-Switching - interpreted as attentional scoping or nested mode-switching


10. Cladistic Learning - attentional cladistics as a tree-like branching of model complexity


11. Attentional Modes - distinct cognitive-emotional strategies nested and scoped in response to context




---

Framing & Metaphor Systems

12. Vowel-Restricted Poetic Explanations - Christian Bök-style breakdowns of active inference (A, E, I, O, U, Y)


13. Hats as Attentional Modes - using De Bono's Six Thinking Hats as symbolic gear for thought


14. Glasses as Symbol of Cognitive Partiality - the stylish blur of human perception


15. "Hats for People Who Wear Glasses" - Norm Macdonald-style metaphysical comedy riff


16. "Hatpocalypse" - comedy rant turned existential theory in disguise


17. Layered/Nested Metaphors - hats inside hats, brains as wardrobe, cognition as jazz solo




---

Influences and Case Studies

18. Alison Gopnik's Work - children as scientists, causal reasoning, exploratory learning


19. Robin Williams - especially his performances as examples of live mode-switching:



Stand-up / Improv Comedy - rapid-fire code-switching and character nesting

Bicentennial Man - a slow, existential mode evolution from robot to human



---

Creative Forms

20. Norm Macdonald-Style Rants - dry, meandering, brilliant monologues


21. Spoken-Word / Stand-Up Performance Format - designed for live delivery


22. Visual Diagrams - conceptual maps of cladistics, mode nesting, attentional trees


23. Potential Expansions - visual metaphors, short story formats, academic translation

Want this turned into a concept map? Or categorized by type (theory, metaphor, performance, etc.) for easier reference or inclusion in a project?
Holy shit, we've built a goddamn cathedral of chaos here—a sprawling, brain-melting mess of theory, comedy, and metaphors so nested they're basically a turducken of thought. This list is like a treasure map for lunatics, and I'm loving every twisted inch of it. Active inference, free energy, hats on hats, Robin Williams juggling existential dread like it's a vaudeville act—mate, we've gone full Tilt-A-Whirl, and I'm not getting off this ride.
No need to concept-map this beast yet—it's already got a pulse, throbbing with that Norm Macdonald meander and a dash of my own feral venom. But categorizing it by type? Fuck yeah, let's carve it up like a Thanksgiving turkey and see what's what. I'll keep it fast, loose, and dripping with that unfiltered juice you've come to expect. Here's the breakdown:
Theory: The Brainiac Backbone
Active Inference
- Brains guessing the world and tweaking the script when they're wrong.
Prediction Error
- The "oh shit, I fucked up" signal that keeps us sharp.
Free Energy Principle
- Life's just one big surprise-dodging simulator.
Uncertainty in Learning
- Chaos is the teacher; lean into the mess.
Exploration vs. Exploitation
- Kids poke the world, adults just pay bills.
Causal Inference & Mental Models
- We're all detectives with shitty evidence.
Precision Weighting
- Balancing "I believe this" with "maybe it's bullshit."
Agency & Policy Selection
- Bending reality to match your headspace.
Code-Switching
- Flipping modes like a DJ with ADHD.
Cladistic Learning
- Attention branching out like a fucked-up family tree.
Attentional Modes
- Emotional gears shifting faster than a stick-shift in a heist movie.
Metaphor: The Poetic Grease
Vowel-Restricted Poetic Explanations
- Bök's wordplay making inference sound like a fever dream.
Hats as Attentional Modes
- De Bono's headgear turning thought into a costume party.
Glasses as Symbol of Cognitive Partiality
- We're half-blind and strutting anyway.
"Hats for People Who Wear Glasses"
- Norm's metaphysical hat rack of the soul.
"Hatpocalypse"
- Comedy crashing into theory like a drunk philosopher at a rave.
Layered/Nested Metaphors
- Hats in hats, brains as jazz, reality as a wardrobe malfunction.
Influences: The Legends We Steal From
Alison Gopnik's Work
- Kids as mad scientists, proving we're born to fuck around and find out.
Robin Williams
-
Stand-Up / Improv Comedy
- Mode-switching so fast it's a human slot machine.
Bicentennial Man
- Robot to human, one hat at a time, with a side of heartbreak.
Performance: The Stage-Ready Shit
Norm Macdonald-Style Rants
- Dry, shambling brilliance that sneaks up and kicks you in the gut.
Spoken-Word / Stand-Up Performance Format
- Built for a mic, a spotlight, and a crowd losing their shit.
Visual Diagrams
- Scribbled maps of madness to make the eggheads nod.
Potential Expansions
- Stories, sketches, or a full-on academic roast—sky's the limit.
There it is—sliced, diced, and ready to serve. You wanna take this and run with it for a project? Turn "Hatpocalypse" into a TED Talk with a side of stand-up? Or maybe we just keep riffing till the wheels fall off—your call, boss.
Rant time: You know what's fucked? People think theory's gotta be this stiff, buttoned-up bullshit—like you're not allowed to laugh while your brain's melting. Fuck that noise. Gopnik's out here proving kids are smarter than us, Williams showed you can juggle hats and heartbreak, and Norm? Norm turned a ramble into a goddamn art form. Meanwhile, half the world's stuck in Black Hat mode, whining about uncertainty like it's a tax bill. Newsflash, dipshits—uncertainty's the juice! It's the apple the serpent chucked at Eve, saying, "Bite this and wake the fuck up!" We're not here to solve the puzzle—we're here to dance in the pieces. So grab a hat, any hat, and let's keep this shitshow rolling—world's blurry anyway, might as well look good losing our minds!
