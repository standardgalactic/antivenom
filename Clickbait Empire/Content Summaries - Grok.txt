Key improvements made:
Structure
:
Added a
main()
function to organize the execution flow
Used
readonly
for constants
Better function organization with clear purposes
Error Handling
:
Added checks for file/directory readability
Redirected error messages to stderr (
>&2
)
Added trap for script interruption
Added error checking for critical operations (mktemp, split, etc.)
Safety
:
Improved temporary directory creation with
-t
flag
Added more robust file existence checks
Better quoting of variables to handle spaces in filenames
Clarity
:
Added more detailed comments
Consistent indentation
Meaningful variable names
Separated log initialization into its own function
Efficiency
:
Reduced redundant checks
Combined some echo statements
Used
continue
instead of nested conditions where appropriate
To use this script:
Ensure you have write permissions in the current directory
Make it executable:
chmod +x script.sh
Run it:
./script.sh
Requires
ollama
and
split
commands to be available
The script maintains its original functionality while being more robust and maintainable. It processes .txt files, splits them into 100-line chunks, generates summaries using ollama, and tracks progress.
I would like to skip the file overview.txt and the output summary
Here's the modified version of the script that skips processing "overview.txt" and removes the detailed summary output to "$SUMMARY_FILE", keeping only the progress log:

Key changes made:
Removed
SUMMARY_FILE
constant and all references to it
Added
SKIP_FILE="overview.txt"
constant
Added a check to skip "overview.txt" in the
process_files
function
Removed the
ollama
summarization step, keeping only progress logging
Updated log messages to reflect the changes
Kept the file splitting functionality but removed the summary generation
The script now:
Skips processing any file named "overview.txt"
Only logs progress to "progress.log"
Still splits files into 100-line chunks but doesn't generate summaries
Maintains the same directory traversal and error handling
To use:
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
Check "progress.log" for processing details
The script will process all .txt files except "overview.txt" and log the progress without creating summaries.
no i wanted the summary
I apologize for the misunderstanding. Based on your original request "I would like to skip the file overview.txt and the output summary," I thought you meant to skip both the file "overview.txt" and the summary output. It seems you meant to skip "overview.txt" but keep the summary output to "detailed-summary.txt". Here's the corrected version:
bash
Collapse
Wrap
Copy

Changes made:
Kept the
SUMMARY_FILE
constant and all summary generation functionality
Added
SKIP_FILE="overview.txt"
constant
Added a check in
process_files
to skip "overview.txt"
Maintained the original summarization process using
ollama
This version will:
Skip processing any file named "overview.txt"
Process all other .txt files by splitting them into 100-line chunks
Generate summaries for each chunk using
ollama run vanilj/phi-4
Save summaries to "detailed-summary.txt"
Log progress to "progress.log"
To use:
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
Check "progress.log" for processing details and "detailed-summary.txt" for summaries
Let me know if I misunderstood again or if you need any other adjustments!
Is it giving output to the terminal?
In the current version of the script, there is limited output to the terminal. Let's analyze what gets displayed and adjust based on your preference:
Current Terminal Output
From
process_files
function
:
echo "Processing directory: $dir" | tee -a "$MAIN_DIR/$PROGRESS_FILE"
- This line outputs "Processing directory: [directory_path]" to both the terminal and the progress log.
echo "Processing $file_name" | tee -a "$MAIN_DIR/$PROGRESS_FILE"
- This line outputs "Processing [filename]" to both the terminal and the progress log.
No other direct terminal output
:
All other
echo
statements redirect to
$PROGRESS_FILE
or
$SUMMARY_FILE
using
>>
, so they don't appear in the terminal.
Expected Behavior
You see "Processing directory: ..." and "Processing [filename]" in the terminal as the script runs.
All other progress messages (e.g., temp directory creation, chunk processing) and summaries go to the log files only.
If You Want More Terminal Output
If you'd like more feedback in the terminal (e.g., all progress messages), we can modify the script to echo to the terminal in addition to logging. Here's an updated version that outputs more to the terminal:

Changes Made
Replaced most
>> "$MAIN_DIR/$PROGRESS_FILE"
with
| tee -a "$MAIN_DIR/$PROGRESS_FILE"
to display messages in the terminal while still logging them.
The summaries still go only to
$SUMMARY_FILE
(not the terminal), as that seems to be the intended behavior.
New Terminal Output
Now you'll see in the terminal:
"Script started at [date]"
"Summaries will be saved to detailed-summary.txt"
"Processing directory: [path]"
"Skipping overview.txt" (when applicable)
"Processing [filename]"
"Created temp directory: [path]"
"File split into chunks"
"Summarizing chunk: [chunk_name]"
"Removed temp directory: [path]"
"Script completed at [date]"
Any error/warning messages
The summaries themselves remain in "detailed-summary.txt" only.
Questions
Is this the level of terminal output you wanted?
Would you like the summaries to appear in the terminal too? (I can modify it to
tee
the
ollama
output if desired.)
Any other adjustments needed?
I want the output of the summaries as well 
Created temp directory: /tmp/tmp_2402.01030v4.txt_S6rt3Q
File split into chunks
Summarizing chunk: chunk_aa
Summarizing chunk: chunk_ab

Key Change
Modified the
ollama run
line from:
bash
Collapse
Wrap
Copy
ollama run vanilj/phi-4
"Summarize:"
<
"
$chunk
"
>>
"
$MAIN_DIR
/
$SUMMARY_FILE
"
2>/dev/null
to:
bash
Collapse
Wrap
Copy
ollama run vanilj/phi-4
"Summarize:"
<
"
$chunk
"
| tee -a
"
$MAIN_DIR
/
$SUMMARY_FILE
"
2>/dev/null
This uses
tee
to send the summary output to both the terminal and the summary file.
Terminal Output Now Includes
"Script started at [date]"
"Summaries will be saved to detailed-summary.txt"
"Processing directory: [path]"
"Skipping overview.txt" (when applicable)
"Processing [filename]"
"Created temp directory: /tmp/tmp_2402.01030v4.txt_S6rt3Q" (example)
"File split into chunks"
"Summarizing chunk: chunk_aa"
[Actual summary text from ollama for chunk_aa]
"Summarizing chunk: chunk_ab"
[Actual summary text from ollama for chunk_ab]
"Removed temp directory: [path]"
"Script completed at [date]"
Any error/warning messages
Example Terminal Output
Based on your sample, it would look something like:
text
Collapse
Wrap
Copy
Processing directory: /home/user/docs
Processing 2402.01030v4.txt
Created temp directory: /tmp/tmp_2402.01030v4.txt_S6rt3Q
File split into chunks
Summarizing chunk: chunk_aa
[Summary text for first 100 lines]
Summarizing chunk: chunk_ab
[Summary text for next 100 lines]
Removed temp directory: /tmp/tmp_2402.01030v4.txt_S6rt3Q
Notes
The summaries are still saved to "detailed-summary.txt" as before.
The progress messages continue to be logged to "progress.log".
If the summaries are very long, this might flood the terminal—let me know if you want to limit or format the terminal output differently.
Is this what you had in mind? Any further tweaks needed?
