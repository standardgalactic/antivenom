AutoHotkey Script Troubleshooting - Grok
My script is not working: #NoEnv  ; Recommended for performance and compatibility with future AutoHotkey releases.
; #Warn  ; Enable warnings to assist with detecting common errors.
SendMode Input  ; Recommended for new scripts due to its superior speed and reliability.
SetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir%  ; Ensures a consistent starting directory.

Let's troubleshoot your AutoHotkey script. The script is intended to send
Ctrl+Z
(undo) every 10 seconds using a timer. From what I can see, the syntax looks mostly correct, but there could be a few reasons it's not working as expected. Here's a step-by-step analysis and some fixes:
Potential Issues and Solutions
Script Not Running or Paused
If the script isn't doing anything, it might not be running at all. Ensure you've saved the file with a
.ahk
extension (e.g.,
script.ahk
) and double-clicked it to launch. You should see a green "H" icon in your system tray if it's active.
If the icon appears but nothing happens, the script might be running fine, but the
Send
command isn't reaching the intended application.
Fix
: Test the script by adding a simple hotkey to confirm it's active. Add this at the top of your script:
autohotkey
Collapse
Wrap
Copy
F1::
MsgBox Script is running!
Save, reload the script, and press
F1
. If a message box pops up, the script is running.
Timer Not Triggering
The
SetTimer, SendUndo, 10000
line looks correct—it should call the
SendUndo
label every 10 seconds. However, if the script is stuck or the timer isn't starting, it won't execute.
Fix
: Add a debug message to verify the timer is working. Modify the
SendUndo
label like this:
autohotkey
Collapse
Wrap
Copy
SendUndo:
MsgBox Undo sent!
Send,
^z
return
Reload the script and wait 10 seconds. If the message box appears, the timer is functioning.
Focus Issue
The
Send
command sends keystrokes to the active window. If the window you want to send
Ctrl+Z
to isn't in focus when the timer triggers, nothing will happen.
Fix
: Activate the target window before sending the keystroke. Replace the
SendUndo
label with something like this (adjust
WindowTitle
to match your application):
autohotkey
Collapse
Wrap
Copy
SendUndo:
WinActivate,
WindowTitle
Sleep
100
; Small delay to ensure the window is active
Send,
^z
return
For example, if it's Notepad, use
WinActivate, Untitled - Notepad
.
Permissions or Application Compatibility
Some applications (especially games or those running as admin) might not respond to
Send
if the script isn't running with sufficient privileges or if the app blocks simulated input.
Fix
: Run the script as administrator. Right-click the
.ahk
file, select "Run as administrator," and test again. Also, ensure the target app accepts
Ctrl+Z
as an undo command.
SendMode Compatibility
SendMode Input
is fast and reliable for most cases, but some applications might work better with
SendMode Event
or
SendMode Play
.
Fix
: Try changing
SendMode Input
to
SendMode Event
and see if that helps:
autohotkey
Collapse
Wrap
Copy
SendMode Event
Revised Working Script
Here's an improved version with debugging and focus handling:
autohotkey
Collapse
Wrap
Copy
#NoEnv
SendMode Input
SetWorkingDir %
A_ScriptDir
%
#SingleInstance force
; Test hotkey to confirm script is running
F1::
MsgBox Script is running!
SetTimer,
SendUndo,
10000
; Run every 10 seconds
return
SendUndo:
WinActivate,
Untitled - Notepad
; Replace with your window title
Sleep
100
Send,
^z
MsgBox Undo sent!
; Remove this line after testing
return
Steps to Test
Save the script as
test.ahk
.
Open Notepad (or your target app).
Double-click the script to run it.
Press
F1
to confirm it's active.
Wait 10 seconds and watch for the message box and
Ctrl+Z
effect (e.g., undoing text in Notepad).
If It Still Doesn't Work
Let me know what application you're targeting and what you expect
Ctrl+Z
to do.
Tell me if you see any error messages or if the debug
MsgBox
appears.
We can refine it further based on your feedback!
What's the next thing you'd like to try?
Ok I tried this the undo function doesn't work but the f3 shortcut does: #NoEnv
SendMode Input
SetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir%
#SingleInstance force

; Test hotkey to confirm script is running
F1::MsgBox Script is running!

SetTimer, SendUndo, 10000 ; Run every 10 seconds
return

SendUndo:
Sleep 100
Send, ^z
Return

F3::
Send, ^z
Return
Thanks for the update! It's great that the
F3
hotkey works to send
Ctrl+Z
, but the timer-driven
SendUndo
label isn't functioning as expected. This tells us the script is running, and the
Send, ^z
command works in principle (since
F3
triggers it), but there's an issue with the timer or its execution context. Let's narrow it down and fix it.
Observations
F3::Send, ^z
works
: This means
SendMode Input
and
Send, ^z
are compatible with your target application when triggered manually.
SetTimer, SendUndo, 10000
doesn't work
: The timer is either not firing, or the
Send, ^z
inside
SendUndo
isn't reaching the active window.
Likely Culprit: Window Focus
Since
F3
works when you press it (and you're likely focused on the target app at that moment), but the timer doesn't, the issue is probably that the active window isn't the one you want when the timer triggers. Without a
WinActivate
command,
Send, ^z
goes to whatever window is active every 10 seconds, which might not be your intended target.
Revised Script with Focus Fix
Let's explicitly activate the window you want before sending
Ctrl+Z
. Replace
Untitled - Notepad
with the title of the window you're targeting (you can find this by using Window Spy, included with AutoHotkey, or by checking the title bar of the app).
autohotkey
Collapse
Wrap
Copy
#NoEnv
SendMode Input
SetWorkingDir %
A_ScriptDir
%
#SingleInstance force
; Test hotkey to confirm script is running
F1::
MsgBox Script is running!
SetTimer,
SendUndo,
10000
; Run every 10 seconds
return
SendUndo:
WinActivate,
Untitled - Notepad
; Replace with your app's window title
Sleep
100
; Give the window time to activate
Send,
^z
return
F3::
Send,
^z
return
How to Find the Window Title
Right-click the AutoHotkey tray icon and select "Window Spy" (or run
AU3_Spy.exe
from the AutoHotkey folder).
Focus the app you want to send
Ctrl+Z
to.
Look at the "Window Title" field in Window Spy. Copy the exact text (e.g., "Microsoft Word - Document1" or "Google Chrome").
Replace
Untitled - Notepad
in the script with that title.
Additional Debugging
If the window title fix doesn't work, let's confirm the timer is firing. Add a debug message to the
SendUndo
label:
autohotkey
Collapse
Wrap
Copy
SendUndo:
MsgBox Timer triggered!
; This should pop up every 10 seconds
WinActivate,
Untitled - Notepad
; Replace with your app's window title
Sleep
100
Send,
^z
return
If the message box appears every 10 seconds but
Ctrl+Z
doesn't work, the timer is fine, and the issue is still focus or compatibility.
If the message box doesn't appear, there's a problem with the timer itself.
Questions for You
What app are you targeting?
Knowing this (e.g., Notepad, Word, a game) will help me tailor the solution.
Does the debug message appear?
Run the script with the
MsgBox
and let me know.
Is the app running as admin?
If so, run the script as admin too (right-click > Run as administrator).
Next Steps
Try the revised script with the correct window title. If it still doesn't work, share the app name and the debug results, and we'll dig deeper—maybe into
SendMode
tweaks or alternative input methods. What do you think?
can't i do it to whatever windows is selected
Yes, you can absolutely send
Ctrl+Z
to whatever window is currently active (selected) without specifying a particular window title! Since your
F3
hotkey works on the active window, we can make the timer do the same by simply relying on the active window context, skipping
WinActivate
. The issue might just be that the timer's execution isn't aligning with your expectations, so let's refine it.
Why It Might Not Be Working
Even without
WinActivate
, the timer should send
Ctrl+Z
to the active window every 10 seconds. If it's not, it could be:
The timer isn't firing consistently.
The active window isn't accepting the input at the exact moment the timer triggers.
A subtle timing or focus issue.
Simplified Script for Active Window
Here's a cleaned-up version that sends
Ctrl+Z
to whatever window is active, with some debugging to confirm it's working:
autohotkey
Collapse
Wrap
Copy
#NoEnv
SendMode Input
SetWorkingDir %
A_ScriptDir
%
#SingleInstance force
; Test hotkey to confirm script is running
F1::
MsgBox Script is running!
SetTimer,
SendUndo,
10000
; Run every 10 seconds
return
SendUndo:
Send,
^z
TrayTip,
Undo Sent, Ctrl+Z sent to active window,
1
; Brief notification
return
F3::
Send,
^z
return
What This Does
SetTimer, SendUndo, 10000
: Triggers
SendUndo
every 10 seconds.
SendUndo
: Sends
Ctrl+Z
to the currently active window (no
WinActivate
needed).
TrayTip
: Shows a small notification near the system tray to confirm the command fired (disappears after 1 second). This avoids intrusive
MsgBox
popups during testing.
F3
: Your manual test hotkey, which already works.
Testing It
Save and run the script.
Press
F1
to confirm it's active.
Open any app that supports
Ctrl+Z
(e.g., Notepad, Word, a text editor).
Type something, then wait 10 seconds. You should see:
The
TrayTip
notification ("Undo Sent").
The last action undone (e.g., text removed).
If It Still Doesn't Work
Check the TrayTip
: If you see "Undo Sent" every 10 seconds but no undo happens, the issue is with the
Send
command reaching the active window.
Try a Delay
: Add
Sleep 50
before
Send, ^z
to ensure the system has time to process the input:
autohotkey
Collapse
Wrap
Copy
SendUndo:
Sleep
50
Send,
^z
TrayTip,
Undo Sent, Ctrl+Z sent to active window,
1
return
Switch SendMode
: If
SendMode Input
isn't working, try
SendMode Event
:
autohotkey
Collapse
Wrap
Copy
SendMode Event
Questions for You
Does the
TrayTip
show up every 10 seconds?
Does
Ctrl+Z
undo anything in the active window when the timer fires?
What app are you testing this with?
Let me know how it goes, and we'll tweak it until it's perfect for your active window!
