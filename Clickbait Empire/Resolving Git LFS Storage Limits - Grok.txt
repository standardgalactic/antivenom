Resolving Git LFS Storage Limits - Grok
I can't figure out how to turn back on LFS batch response: Git LFS is disabled for this repository.
I hit a LFS 1.5 GB free limit and it turned it off I think, but I don't see it on my github or in the repository
25 web pages
When Git LFS is disabled for a repository on GitHub, it's typically due to exceeding the free storage or bandwidth limits (1 GB of storage and 1 GB of bandwidth per month for free accounts). Once you hit the 1.5 GB limit you mentioned, GitHub may restrict LFS functionality until the quota issue is resolved. The message "Git LFS is disabled for this repository" suggests that LFS operations (like pushing or pulling large files) are currently blocked. Unfortunately, GitHub doesn't provide a direct toggle in the repository settings to "turn LFS back on" — the solution involves managing your LFS usage or upgrading your account. Here's how you can address this:
Steps to Resolve and Re-enable Git LFS Functionality
Check Your LFS Usage on GitHub
Go to your GitHub account settings: Click your profile picture in the top-right corner, then select
Settings
.
Navigate to
Billing and plans
(under "Access" or "Account" depending on your account type).
Look for the
Git LFS Data
section. This will show your current storage and bandwidth usage (e.g., "Storage: 1.5 GB / 1 GB").
If you've exceeded the free 1 GB storage limit, GitHub restricts LFS until you free up space or purchase additional data packs.
Free Up LFS Storage
Git LFS storage counts every version of every large file you've pushed. To reduce usage:
Identify Large Files
: Clone your repository locally (
git clone <repo-url>
) and run
git lfs ls-files
to see which files are tracked by LFS and their sizes.
Remove Old Versions
: If you don't need historical versions of large files, you can rewrite history to remove them. Use a tool like
BFG Repo-Cleaner
:
Download BFG (e.g.,
bfg.jar
from
https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/
).
Run:
java -jar bfg.jar --strip-blobs-bigger-than 100M <repo>.git
(adjust the size threshold as needed).
Clean up:
cd <repo>.git && git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive
.
Force push:
git push --force
.
Note
: This rewrites history, so coordinate with collaborators to avoid conflicts.
After reducing usage below 1 GB, LFS should automatically re-enable, though it may take some time for GitHub to update.
Purchase Additional LFS Data
If you need to keep all your large files:
In the
Billing and plans
section, find
Git LFS Data
and click
Add more data
.
Purchase a data pack (e.g., $5/month for 50 GB of storage and bandwidth).
Once purchased, LFS functionality should resume without needing further action in the repository.
Verify LFS Status in the Repository
GitHub doesn't explicitly show an "LFS disabled" toggle in repository settings, but you can confirm LFS is working again by:
Running
git lfs push origin main
(or your branch) locally after resolving the quota issue.
If it succeeds without errors like "batch response: Git LFS is disabled," LFS is back on.
Check Local Configuration
Ensure Git LFS is still set up locally:
Run
git lfs install
to initialize LFS for your user account (only needed once).
Verify your
.gitattributes
file in the repository still tracks the desired file types (e.g.,
*.psd filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
).
If you suspect a local issue, test with a small LFS-tracked file:
git lfs track "testfile.zip"
, add it, commit, and push.
Why You Don't See It in GitHub Settings
GitHub manages LFS at the account level tied to billing quotas, not as a per-repository on/off switch. The "disabled" state is a consequence of exceeding limits, not a manual setting you can flip. Once you're back under the limit or purchase more data, LFS reactivates automatically.
If It Still Doesn't Work
Contact GitHub Support
: If you've reduced usage or added a data pack and LFS still isn't working, go to
https://support.github.com
and submit a ticket. Mention your repository name and the "Git LFS is disabled" error.
Temporary Workaround
: If urgent, clone the repo locally, disable LFS tracking for problematic files (
git lfs migrate export --include="*.largefile"
), and push them as regular Git objects (if under 100 MB each), though this defeats the purpose of LFS.
Let me know if you need help with any of these steps! What's your current LFS usage showing in your billing settings? That'll help narrow down the next move.
I had my budget set to 0 dollars maybe that was it I put it to 11 dollars it might help
Setting your budget to $0 could indeed be the culprit! GitHub ties Git LFS functionality to your account's billing plan, and if your budget is capped at $0, it effectively disables additional usage beyond the free tier (1 GB storage and 1 GB bandwidth). By increasing it to $11, you've likely allowed GitHub to allocate funds for extra LFS data, which should re-enable LFS functionality for your repository. Here's what's probably happening and how to confirm it worked:
What Changing the Budget Does
With a $0 budget, GitHub restricts LFS once you hit the free limits (e.g., your 1.5 GB storage). It won't dip into any additional spending, so LFS gets disabled.
Setting it to $11 signals GitHub that you're willing to pay for overages (e.g., data packs at $5 per 50 GB). This doesn't immediately buy a data pack but allows GitHub to charge you if you exceed the free tier, lifting the restriction.
Check If It's Working Now
Wait a Few Minutes
: GitHub might take a short time to process the budget change and re-enable LFS.
Test a Push
:
Go to your local repository.
Run
git lfs push origin main
(or your branch).
If it succeeds without the "batch response: Git LFS is disabled" error, you're back in business!
Check Billing Settings
:
Go to
Settings > Billing and plans > Git LFS Data
on GitHub.
See if your usage (1.5 GB) is now accepted under the new $11 budget. You might see a pending charge if it's allocating a data pack.
Next Steps If It's Fixed
Monitor Usage
: With 1.5 GB already used, you're over the free 1 GB limit. A $5 data pack (50 GB) will likely kick in soon, deducted from your $11 budget. Keep an eye on it to avoid surprises.
Adjust Budget
: If $11 isn't enough for future usage, you can bump it higher in the same billing section.
If It's Still Disabled
Force a Refresh
: Sometimes GitHub needs a nudge. Try pushing a small LFS-tracked file (e.g.,
echo "test" > testfile.bin
,
git lfs track "*.bin"
,
git add .
,
git commit -m "test"
,
git push
).
Double-Check Budget
: Ensure the $11 budget is applied to the correct organization or personal account tied to the repository.
Reach Out
: If no luck, GitHub Support (
https://support.github.com
) can confirm if the budget change propagated correctly.
Let me know how the push goes after the budget tweak — that'll tell us if $11 did the trick! What's the repository tied to — a personal account or an org? That might affect where the budget applies.
I have a file chat.html that is 200 mb I was going to break it up into smaller files but breaking it up by lines didn't work because maybe some of the lines are really long I don't think I can open an html file that large on my computer it's too old, i was thinking of breaking up chat.html in to pieces and conversation.json and putting them in folders so that I could upload it to github, like 5 mb pieces with a bash script
A 200 MB
chat.html
file is definitely too big to handle easily on an older computer, and splitting it by lines might not work well if you've got massive lines (e.g., embedded data or unformatted text). Breaking it into smaller chunks like 5 MB pieces is a solid plan, especially for GitHub, since even with LFS, smaller files are easier to manage and less likely to choke on upload. Converting parts to
conversation.json
and organizing them into folders also makes sense for structure and readability. Let's get you a Bash script to split that beast and set it up for GitHub with LFS.
Why Lines Didn't Work
If some lines are disproportionately long (e.g., a single line with megabytes of inline data), tools like
split -l
(split by lines) won't balance the file sizes. Splitting by byte size instead (e.g., 5 MB chunks) will give you more predictable pieces, regardless of line length.
Bash Script to Split
chat.html
Here's a script to chop
chat.html
into 5 MB pieces, name them sensibly, and optionally prep them for JSON conversion or folder organization:
bash
Collapse
Wrap
Copy
#!/bin/bash
# Input file
INPUT_FILE=
"chat.html"
# Size per chunk (5 MB = 5 * 1024 * 1024 bytes)
CHUNK_SIZE=$((
5
*
1024
*
1024
))
# Output directory
OUTPUT_DIR=
"chat_chunks"
# Prefix for split files
PREFIX=
"chat_part_"
# Create output directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p
"
$OUTPUT_DIR
"
# Split the file into 5 MB chunks
split -b
"
$CHUNK_SIZE
"
"
$INPUT_FILE
"
"
$OUTPUT_DIR
/
$PREFIX
"
echo
"Split complete! Files are in
$OUTPUT_DIR
/"
ls -lh
"
$OUTPUT_DIR
"
How to Use It
Save this as
split_chat.sh
.
Make it executable:
chmod +x split_chat.sh
.
Run it:
./split_chat.sh
.
Check the
chat_chunks
folder — you'll get files like
chat_part_aa
,
chat_part_ab
, etc., each ~5 MB.
What It Does
split -b $CHUNK_SIZE
: Splits by byte size, not lines, ensuring each chunk is roughly 5 MB.
Files go into
chat_chunks/
with names like
chat_part_aa
,
chat_part_ab
(incrementing suffixes).
The
ls -lh
at the end shows you the resulting file sizes.
Handling JSON Conversion
If you want some pieces as
conversation.json
, you'll need to decide which parts of
chat.html
represent structured data (e.g., chat logs) and convert them. Since your computer struggles with the full 200 MB file, process the chunks individually. Here's an approach:
Inspect a Chunk
: Open
chat_chunks/chat_part_aa
in a text editor that can handle 5 MB (e.g.,
nano
,
vim
, or even Notepad on Windows should work).
Manual Conversion
: If it's HTML with chat data (e.g.,
<div class="message">...</div>
), write a small script to parse it to JSON. For example, in Python (if you can run it on a chunk):
python
Collapse
Wrap
Copy
import
re
import
json
with
open
(
"chat_chunks/chat_part_aa"
,
"r"
)
as
f:
content = f.read()
# Simple example: extract text between <div> tags
messages = re.findall(
r'<div class="message">(.*?)</div>'
, content)
conversation = [{
"message"
: msg}
for
msg
in
messages]
with
open
(
"chat_chunks/conversation_aa.json"
,
"w"
)
as
out:
json.dump(conversation, out)
Automate
: Loop this over all chunks in Bash:
bash
Collapse
Wrap
Copy
for
file
in
chat_chunks/chat_part_*;
do
python3 convert_to_json.py
"
$file
"
done
Adjust the regex or parsing logic based on your HTML structure.
Organizing for GitHub
Folders
: Move files into subfolders like
chat_chunks/part1/
,
chat_chunks/part2/
, etc., grouping related pieces:
bash
Collapse
Wrap
Copy
mkdir -p chat_chunks/part{1..10}
mv chat_chunks/chat_part_a[a-j] chat_chunks/part1/
mv chat_chunks/chat_part_a[k-t] chat_chunks/part2/
# Adjust ranges based on how many files you get
Git LFS Setup
:
In your repo:
git lfs install
.
Track the chunks:
git lfs track "chat_chunks/**/*.html" "chat_chunks/**/*.json"
.
Add
.gitattributes
to Git:
git add .gitattributes
.
Add all files:
git add chat_chunks/
.
Commit and push:
git commit -m "Add split chat files" && git push
.
Uploading to GitHub
Since you bumped your budget to $11, LFS should work now. With 40 chunks (200 MB / 5 MB), you're still over the free 1 GB limit with other files (1.5 GB total), but the $5 data pack from your budget will cover it. Push the repo and watch for errors — if LFS is still disabled, double-check your billing settings or wait a bit longer for the $11 budget to take effect.
If Your Computer Can't Handle It
If even 5 MB is too much:
Lower the chunk size (e.g.,
CHUNK_SIZE=$((1 * 1024 * 1024))
for 1 MB).
Use a cloud service (e.g., Google Colab) to split and process the file remotely.
How does your
chat.html
look — is it mostly text, or does it have big inline assets (like Base64 images)? That'll affect how we refine this. Let me know how the split goes or if you need tweaks!
I just want to use the same technique for spliting both chat.html and conversation.json into chunks perhaps with a flag that can be turned on to put them back together.
Got it — you want a reusable Bash script to split both
chat.html
and
conversation.json
into 5 MB chunks, with an optional flag to reassemble them later. This is a clean way to handle large files for GitHub while keeping the flexibility to merge them back when needed. Here's a script that does both, using the same byte-splitting technique for consistency:
bash
Collapse
Wrap
Copy
#!/bin/bash
# Default chunk size (5 MB = 5 * 1024 * 1024 bytes)
CHUNK_SIZE=$((
5
*
1024
*
1024
))
# Output directory
OUTPUT_DIR=
"chunks"
# Flag to reassemble (default: off)
REASSEMBLE=
false
# Parse command-line flags
while
getopts
"r"
opt;
do
case
$opt
in
r) REASSEMBLE=
true
;;

echo
"Usage:

;
exit
1 ;;
esac
done
# Shift past the options to get the file argument
shift

))
# Check if a file is provided
if
[ -z
"
$1
"
];
then
echo
"Error: Please provide a file to split or reassemble (e.g., chat.html or conversation.json)"
echo
"Usage:

exit
1

How to Use It
Save this as
split_or_join.sh
.
Make it executable:
chmod +x split_or_join.sh
.
Split a File
:
For
chat.html
:
./split_or_join.sh chat.html
For
conversation.json
:
./split_or_join.sh conversation.json
Output: Chunks like
chunks/chat_part_aa
,
chunks/conversation_part_aa
, etc.
Reassemble a File
:
For
chat.html
:
./split_or_join.sh -r chat.html
For
conversation.json
:
./split_or_join.sh -r conversation.json
Output:
chat.reassembled
or
conversation.reassembled
.
What It Does
Splitting
: Uses
split -b
to break the file into 5 MB chunks, named with the file's base name (e.g.,
chat_part_aa
or
conversation_part_aa
), stored in
chunks/
.
Reassembling
: Uses
cat
to concatenate all chunks with the matching prefix back into a single file (e.g.,
chat.reassembled
).
Flag
:
-r
switches to reassemble mode; without it, it splits by default.
Error Check
: Ensures you provide a file name.
Example Run
bash
Collapse
Wrap
Copy
# Split chat.html
./split_or_join.sh chat.html
# Output: chunks/chat_part_aa, chunks/chat_part_ab, etc.
# Split conversation.json
./split_or_join.sh conversation.json
# Output: chunks/conversation_part_aa, etc.
# Reassemble chat.html
./split_or_join.sh -r chat.html
# Output: chat.reassembled
For GitHub
LFS Setup
: After splitting:
bash
Collapse
Wrap
Copy
git lfs install
git lfs track
"chunks/**/*.html"
"chunks/**/*.json"
git add .gitattributes chunks/
git commit -m
"Add split chat and conversation files"
git push
Your $11 budget should handle the 200 MB (40 chunks total), with a $5 data pack covering the overage.
Notes
Chunk Size
: 5 MB works for your 200 MB file (~40 chunks). Adjust
CHUNK_SIZE
if needed (e.g.,
$((1 * 1024 * 1024))
for 1 MB).
File Integrity
: Splitting by bytes might cut mid-line or mid-JSON object, but reassembling with
cat
will restore the exact original file. If you need to process chunks independently, we'd need to split on boundaries (e.g., HTML tags or JSON objects), but that's trickier with your old computer.
Storage
: Chunks go in
chunks/
to keep them organized. You can tweak
OUTPUT_DIR
if you want separate folders (e.g.,
chat_chunks/
vs.
conv_chunks/
).
Try it on
chat.html
first — does it split as expected? Let me know if you want to tweak the size or folder setup!
Write a note explaining that we did this to the files chat.html and conversations.json because they were too large to upload and how to reassemble them
Here's a concise note you can include in your repository (e.g., in a
README.md
or a separate
NOTE.txt
) to explain why
chat.html
and
conversation.json
were split and how to reassemble them:
Note on Split Files:
chat.html
and
conversation.json
The original
chat.html
and
conversation.json
files were too large (approximately 200 MB each) to upload directly to GitHub, exceeding the free Git LFS storage limit and causing upload issues. To resolve this, we split both files into smaller chunks of approximately 5 MB each using a Bash script. These chunks are stored in the
chunks/
directory with prefixes
chat_part_
and
conversation_part_
(e.g.,
chunks/chat_part_aa
,
chunks/conversation_part_ab
, etc.).
Why We Did This
GitHub imposes limits on file sizes and LFS quotas (1 GB free storage). Splitting the files allowed us to upload them within these constraints while utilizing Git LFS for efficient tracking of large files.
Smaller chunks are easier to manage, especially on systems with limited resources.
How to Reassemble the Original Files
To restore the original
chat.html
or
conversation.json
files from their chunks, use the provided Bash script
split_or_join.sh
with the
-r
flag. Follow these steps:
Ensure You Have the Chunks
: Clone the repository or download the
chunks/
directory containing all
chat_part_*
and
conversation_part_*
files.
Run the Script
:
For
chat.html
:
./split_or_join.sh -r chat.html
Output:
chat.reassembled
(the restored original
chat.html
).
For
conversation.json
:
./split_or_join.sh -r conversation.json
Output:
conversation.reassembled
(the restored original
conversation.json
).
Verify
: The reassembled files should match the originals exactly.
Script Details
The script is included in the repository as
split_or_join.sh
. It splits files into 5 MB chunks by default or reassembles them when the
-r
flag is used.
Requirements: Bash (available on Linux, macOS, or WSL on Windows).
If you have questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out!
This note keeps it clear and actionable for anyone working with your repo. You can drop it in the root or alongside the script. Let me know if you'd like it tweaked!
