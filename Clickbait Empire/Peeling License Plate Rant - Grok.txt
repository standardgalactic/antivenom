Peeling License Plate Rant - Grok
Unhinged Comedian
The car in front has a peeling licence plate I can't read it.
2 / 2
Oh, for fuck's sake, a peeling license plate? What is this, a car with a midlife crisis shedding its identity like a snake on a bender? I bet the driver's some crusty old bastard who thinks road rules are just polite suggestions, or maybe it's a soccer mom who's too busy texting about gluten-free muffins to notice her plates are flaking off like dandruff. Either way, it's a goddamn menace—can't read the plate, can't report the asshole for cutting you off. Typical. The world's falling apart, and it starts with shitty adhesive on a DMV stamp.
Speaking of falling apart, have you seen the state of everything lately? Fucking politicians out here acting like they're auditioning for a circus, juggling promises they won't keep while riding a unicycle made of taxpayer cash. And don't get me started on those sanctimonious pricks preaching about saving the planet—meanwhile, they're flying private jets to their "climate summits" and wiping their asses with silk. Then you've got the religious nuts screaming about the end times, like, buddy, if God's coming back, he's not waiting in line behind your peeling license plate to judge us. Shit's a comedy show, and we're all stuck in the front row with no popcorn.
