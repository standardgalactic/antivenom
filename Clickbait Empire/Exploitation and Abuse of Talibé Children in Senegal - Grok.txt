A begging talibé
Begging used to be characterised by the talibé asking for food to supplement the daara's supplies when it could not sustain its own demands from the harvests provided by the marabout's fields.[15] The increasing number of daaras in urban settings has stemmed the traditional forms of support that sustained daaras. The prevalence of almsgiving in Senegalese society has made child begging profitable in cities.[16] In the 1970s, some urban daaras ran seasonally, allowing for marabouts to return to their villages for the harvest. However, it became more economically viable for urban daaras to remain open all year round:

Over time, the marabouts started to stay in the cities...Why return to the village, where they had to work the land for long hours, when [in the city] a child comes daily with money, sugar, and rice?[17]

Perry warns that the above view can imply that only urban daaras exploit talibés. She contends that urban and rural daaras "are the same. There is just one difference: the urban talibe's 'farm' is the urban street, and [the] 'crop' he harvests is cash, and not peanuts."[18]

The practice of marabouts taking on talibés is seldom subject to state regulation, making it easier for abuse of this relationship to occur.[19] The Senegalese government has recently created state-regulated daaras in order to reduce abuses. However, urban daaras with resident talibés form the most common form of Quranic schools.[20]

Some marabouts, instead of teaching their talibés about the Quran, exploit them for labour, typically through forced begging on the streets. The nature of this exploitation exposes such talibés to disease, injury, death, physical abuse and sexual abuse.

A 2007 UNICEF study of child begging in Dakar, the capital of Senegal, found that "the large majority of child beggars (90%) are talibés".[21] UNICEF has estimated there to be between 50,000 and 100,000 begging talibés in Senegal.[22] A 2010 report suggests that the number of talibés is on the rise.[23] Other researchers, however, warn that "estimates on the numbers of street children rest upon largely elastic and nebulous definitions."[24] Indeed, there are no official statistics to substantiate these claims. Others respond that the rise of Arabic-maderas is causing the number of talibés to decline.[25]

HRW has warned that the social status enjoyed by marabouts has emboldened "those responsible for the proliferation of forced child begging and other abuses committed by the marabouts against talibé children."[26] Perry cautiously agrees that "reverence of marabouts and respect for the talibé institution may be a dominant ideology, but it is not now, nor ever was, totalising or uncontested".[27]

Platform for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (PPDH) along with Human Rights Watch, reported in December 2019 the overlooked abuse, exploitation and neglect of thousands of talibé children at traditional Quranic schools. The Senegalese government was accused of neglecting and not doing enough to tackle the widespread and chronic abuse faced by children at the religious schools.[28]

The CRC creates rights to adequate living standards for children, with regard to the means of the primary caregivers, as well as the means of the state to support the primary caregivers.[29] HRW argues that states, parents and marabouts are in breach of CRC in failing to oversee the adequate housing, care and nourishment of talibés.

HRW also cites the following as other abuses of talibés which breach CRC.

Forced begging;[30] HRW argues that this exposes talibés to considerable dangers. HRW documented cases of talibés dying in car accidents while trying to beg on the streets. The exposure to dangerous work, HRW argues, not only threatens the physical and mental security of talibés, but their lives.[31]
Corporal punishment; physical punishments in schools has been described by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, as a type of violence which CRC seeks to stop.[32]
Education; HRW argues that, where a child's education is almost entirely neglected due to copious hours of begging, this may amount to a breach of CRC.[33]
Sexual abuse; CRC requires states to take steps to protect children from sexual abuse.[34]
Leisure; where a marabout denies talibés leisure time, this may breach the child's right "to rest and leisure."[35]
Forced labour and slavery
edit
Recent studies show that talibés average just less than 8 hours per day, every day, begging.[36] The exact sums that a talibé must yield each day vary between daaras. A survey of 175 talibes revealed that the average sum demanded by a marabout is 373 CFA (US$0.79), rising to 445 CFA (US$0.94) on holy days when greater almsgiving is customary.[37] World Bank statistics show that just under 30 percent of Senegal's population lives on less than 593 CFA (US$1.25) per day, and over 55 percent live on less than 949 CFA (US$2.00).[38] This highlights the difficulty talibés have in meeting the quotas requested by marabouts. In addition to financial quotas, some marabouts set quotas for basic foodstuffs such as sugar and rice.[39]

The International Labour Organization (ILO) has opined that the practice of exploiting talibés for labour also falls within the ambit of the Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labour.[40] This is because, its opinion, forced begging is akin to slavery, and because the labour exposes children to a plethora of dangers to their wellbeing.

Some NGOs argue that, where a marabout acquires custody over a talibé in order to force the child to beg, this meets the definition of a practice 'akin to slavery', as defined by the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery.[41] That convention states that receiving a child "with a view to the exploitation of the child or young person or of his labour," is a practice akin to slavery which is subject to the convention.[42]

Physical abuse and torture
edit
Talibés are sometime required by their marabouts to meet a quota of money or basic foods. Failure to meet that quota can result in physical abuse. Human Rights Watch (HRW) documented boys exhibiting scars and welts, usually resulting from the application of electric cables, clubs and canes.[43]

In some daaras, an older, senior talibé, or assistant marabout will be responsible for punishing younger talibés who fail to return their daily quota, or are late returning. In other cases, a marabout might not supervise the children living in the daara, leaving the senior talibés to steal from the younger, as well as abuse them physically and sexually.[44]

The Convention against Torture only applies where the actions are carried out by a state official. However, the committee which oversees that treaty issued an opinion stating that:
Here's a summary of the provided text regarding the
nature of abuse
faced by talibé children in Senegal, based on the traditional Quranic school system and the exploitation they endure:
Historically, talibés—students under the care of marabouts (religious teachers) in Quranic schools called daaras—begged for food to supplement insufficient harvests from marabout-managed fields. However, with the rise of urban daaras and the profitability of almsgiving in Senegalese cities, this practice evolved into year-round forced begging, often replacing agricultural work. Marabouts increasingly exploit talibés for economic gain, demanding daily quotas of money (averaging 373 CFA or US$0.79, rising to 445 CFA or US$0.94 on holy days), rice, and sugar. This shift has turned urban streets into the talibés' "farms," with cash as their "crop," a practice not limited to urban areas but also present in rural daaras.
The lack of state regulation over the marabout-talibé relationship has enabled widespread abuses, despite recent efforts to establish state-regulated daaras. Many marabouts neglect Quranic education, instead forcing talibés to beg for up to 8 hours daily, exposing them to significant risks including disease, injury, car accidents (some fatal), physical and sexual abuse, and exploitation akin to slavery. Human Rights Watch (HRW) and other organizations report that talibés face corporal punishment (e.g., beatings with cables or clubs for failing quotas), neglect of education, denial of leisure, and inadequate living conditions, all breaching the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).
Estimates suggest 50,000 to 100,000 talibés beg in Senegal, with 90% of child beggars in Dakar being talibés (UNICEF, 2007). The practice is exacerbated by the social reverence for marabouts, which shields abusers, though this reverence is contested. HRW and the Platform for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (PPDH) have criticized the Senegalese government for failing to address chronic abuse, neglect, and exploitation. The International Labour Organization (ILO) classifies forced begging as a worst form of child labor, akin to slavery, while some NGOs argue it meets the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery's definition of exploitative custody.
Physical abuse is rampant, with documented cases of scars and welts from beatings, often administered by marabouts or senior talibés tasked with enforcing quotas. Sexual abuse and theft by older talibés also occur in unsupervised daaras. These conditions violate international standards, including the CRC and ILO conventions, highlighting a systemic failure by marabouts, parents, and the state to protect talibé children.
This summary captures the key points of the evolving exploitation and multifaceted abuses faced by talibés, rooted in economic incentives, lack of oversight, and societal dynamics.
Could you tell me more about the 1982 senegambian league
20 web pages
It seems there might be a misunderstanding in your question. There was no "1982 Senegambian League" based on historical records or the context provided. However, I suspect you may be referring to the
Senegambia Confederation
, a political union between Senegal and The Gambia that began in 1982. Since your question is unclear, I'll assume this is what you meant and provide detailed information about the Senegambia Confederation of 1982. If you intended something different (e.g., a sports league), please clarify, and I'll adjust accordingly!
Overview of the Senegambia Confederation (1982-1989)
The Senegambia Confederation was a loose political and economic union between the West African nations of Senegal and The Gambia, officially established on
February 1, 1982
, following an agreement signed on
December 12, 1981
. This confederation aimed to foster cooperation between the two countries, which share deep historical, cultural, and geographic ties—Senegal almost entirely surrounds The Gambia, a small enclave along the Gambia River.
Historical Context
The idea of uniting Senegal and The Gambia predates the 1982 confederation, rooted in their shared precolonial history and colonial divisions by France (Senegal) and Britain (The Gambia). After gaining independence—Senegal in 1960 and The Gambia in 1965—proposals for integration surfaced periodically, driven by economic interdependence and security concerns. The immediate catalyst for the confederation was a failed coup attempt in The Gambia on
July 30, 1981
, led by leftist Kukoi Samba Sanyang against President Dawda Jawara. Senegal intervened militarily at Jawara's request, restoring his government. This event underscored the mutual security interests that prompted the confederation.
Structure and Goals
The confederation was designed to balance cooperation with sovereignty, as both nations retained their independence. Key features included:
Leadership
: The President of Senegal (Abdou Diouf at the time) served as the Confederation's President, while The Gambia's President (Dawda Jawara) was Vice-President.
Military Integration
: The two countries merged their armed and security forces into a
Confederal Army
, dominated by Senegal (two-thirds Senegalese, one-third Gambian). Senegal's military presence in The Gambia persisted post-coup, securing key sites like the airport and harbor.
Economic and Monetary Union
: Plans were made to integrate economies and currencies, though this faced resistance (The Gambia used the dalasi, while Senegal used the CFA franc tied to France).
Foreign Policy and Communications
: Coordination was agreed upon, with a
Confederal Parliament
meeting annually from 1984 and a
Permanent Secretariat
managing implementation.
Cultural Unity
: The confederation sought to bridge francophone Senegal and anglophone Gambia, though linguistic and administrative differences posed challenges.
Challenges and Dynamics
Despite its ambitious goals, the confederation struggled:
Economic Disparities
: The Gambia resisted full economic integration, fearing loss of sovereignty and its lucrative low-duty trade (e.g., smuggling goods into Senegal). Senegal pushed for standardized customs, which threatened Gambian interests.
Military Imbalance
: The Gambia lacked a standing army, making the Confederal Army essentially a Senegalese force, fueling perceptions of domination. Critics in The Gambia saw it as a loss of national autonomy.
Political Will
: Initial enthusiasm waned as stability returned. Gambians grew wary of becoming a Senegalese province, while Senegal's leadership faced domestic pressures (e.g., Diouf's 1983 election).
Social Perceptions
: While elites supported the idea, ordinary citizens showed little interest, and historical stereotypes resurfaced.
Dissolution
The confederation unraveled by the late 1980s. Tensions escalated as The Gambia resisted deeper integration, particularly after Senegal proposed a unitary state over a loose confederation. On
August 23, 1989
, President Diouf dissolved the confederation after failed negotiations, with the formal end on
September 30, 1989
. The split increased friction, with Senegal later accusing The Gambia of supporting Casamance separatists.
Legacy and Significance
The Senegambia Confederation was a rare attempt at post-independence African unity across colonial linguistic divides (French and English). It highlighted both the potential for regional cooperation and the persistent challenges of sovereignty, economic disparity, and political mistrust. The name "Senegambia" persists as a geographic term for the region, distinct from the failed political entity.
If you'd like more specifics—say, on its economic policies, military operations, or cultural impacts—or if you meant something entirely different by "Senegambian League," just let me know!
Yeah that is what I was asking about can you give a shorter summary?
Here's a concise summary of the Senegambia Confederation (1982-1989):
The Senegambia Confederation was a political and economic union between Senegal and The Gambia, launched on February 1, 1982, after Senegal helped suppress a 1981 coup in The Gambia. Led by Senegal's President Abdou Diouf (President) and The Gambia's Dawda Jawara (Vice-President), it aimed to integrate security (via a joint army), economies, and foreign policies while preserving each nation's sovereignty. Despite shared cultural ties, it faced challenges like economic disputes, military imbalances, and Gambian fears of losing autonomy. It dissolved on September 30, 1989, after tensions over deeper integration proved irreconcilable, marking a short-lived experiment in African unity.
