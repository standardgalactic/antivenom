This essay argues that Facebook's core business model is structurally destructive, systematically degrading social reality rather than merely reflecting or amplifying existing harms. Its advertising-driven system monetizes attention under conditions of constraint, selling false hope to advertisers and users alike, while dissolving the meaningful connection between visibility and legitimacy. This creates an environment saturated with scams, implausible promises, and epistemic confusion, forcing users into unpaid defensive labor to manage their feeds.

The degradation extends beyond advertising. The platform's prioritization of short-form, algorithmically driven content (like Reels) erodes long-horizon cognition, displacing the sustained attention needed to acquire complex skills, follow arguments, or engage in creative practice. This represents an "opportunity erosion" that disadvantages the transmission of civilizational knowledge, which is typically encoded in slower, more embodied forms (e.g., books, apprenticeships, hands-on practice).

The author frames this dynamic using thermodynamic and systems theory: Facebook operates as a high-entropy "extraction field" for attention. It maximizes rapid engagement and novelty, which is profitable for the platform but externalizes the cost onto users and society by making low-entropy activities (like learning and skill-building) statistically unlikely and cognitively costly.

Crucially, these harms are not accidental or due to moral failure but are stable, profitable outcomes of the system's design. The platform is insulated from the consequences of widespread advertiser failure and user degradation. This raises the possibility of irreversible civilizational risk, as generations may lose practical, embodied competencies (e.g., repair, construction, care) while becoming fluent only in symbolic, mediated exchange.

In conclusion, Facebook trades long-term societal capacity for short-term extractive profit, actively shaping a future where the ability to think deeply, build, and create is eroded while the illusion that all meaning and competence can be purchased is perpetuated.
