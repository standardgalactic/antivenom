will um evolve pathological Lifestyles
lifestyles of addiction dependency and
abuse
but those people usually can evolve
these Lifestyles with there are
perfectly legal Avenues to evolve these
Lifestyles I mean there is alcohol is
obviously more conducive to these
maladaptive Lifestyles than almost
anything
else if I were totally Juiced you could
tell it if I were a lifelong junkie and
I had just shot I could deliver this
this lecture it wouldn't trigger any
awareness in you so the
debilitating damage
maladaptive drugs are all
legal and what is restricted then is
stuff which gives you funny
ideas that's the problem the funny ideas
category well put that way it doesn't
take long to see why because funny ideas
are
very problematic for
institutions on the other hand funny
ideas are the life breath of
creativity so who are we going to make
comfortable a bunch of control
freaks see I think it was really a
mistake in the
60s to try and take Society away from
the people who want to run it to wage
Revolution with psychedelic drugs where
I don't know if those people realized
but their their weapon was effective
enough that the world's first nuclear
power was quaking in its booths because
you could produce 102 40 million hits of
LSD well so that that's terrifying to an
establishment because what if you
changed 20 60 40 million
minds but if it can be kept in a human
scale where you say out in
California people people hang out at
esselin and then they take off their
clothes and then they meditate and then
a few of them go on to
drugs this is not this doesn't threaten
anybody the the way in which LSD was
used to
thumb noses at The
Establishment brought trouble it I don't
think should have been seen as a direct
tool of Social and pol itical action it
should have been handled as a adjunct to
creativity its agenda would have
surfaced we would have ended up in a
better place this is what Aldis Huxley
wanted to do you know he felt that you
go to the people to the power freaks in
a nonthreatening way you don't say to
them hey Mr Dean hey Mr President a
100,000 acid heads have surrounded your
administration building and if you don't
exceed to these 15
non-negotiable demands we're going to
pull the place apart but no you send uh
uh his friend that he went to Yale with
to him who says you know a few of us
have been getting together and there's
really this extraordinary thing
happening and we think you should be
brought in on this this is going to be
tremendous but it
polarized I find it hard to understand I
mean I like ly very much and metzner is
a close personal friend of mine but I'm
now 42 years old I'm the age liry was
when he was fired from
Harvard if I were fired from esselin so
to speak my response would not to be a
tool of the major campuses of America to
set the troops marching and sending the
checks home to Mom and Dad I'm delighted
that people 16 to 25 are interested in
what I have to say but I don't see
myself as the pope of the Children's
Crusade it's not like that at all uh we
need to reach creative people in all
levels of society and in all positions
of power creative people will respond to
this it is after all a personal thing
it's a personal thing uh the revolution
that wanted to give everybody LSD also
wanted to uh have sex in the streets
this was a banner I've shouted it myself
through the streets but hey uh is that
going to do a lot for relationships
to have an orgy at the corner of bangro
and Telegraph will will this make us all
