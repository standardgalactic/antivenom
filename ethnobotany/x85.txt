and so on these are the tools out of
which an understanding of the Dynamics
of mind can be created and creating an
understanding of the Dynamics of mind is
the way out of the political Log Jam no
amount of hanging and preaching is going
to do it it requires a breakthrough to
the mechanics of ourselves
that's what it basically comes down to
that we must see ourselves as
potentially salvageable
reprogrammable and worth saving and I
think that because the Psychedelic
experience is not bound in
history but in a way is a morphogenetic
field amplifier of our species I mean if
you think of the sheld drai model of of
morphogenetic fields and then imagine
that they cannot be detected by radio
they cannot be detected by any
electronic uh means the field is too
subtle but if you imagine that mind is a
Quantum mechanically indeterminate and
delicately balanced enough system that
it can actually resonate to the presence
of the morphogenetic field
then you begin to have a theory of what
the Psychedelic experience is it's the
experience of the Transcendent dimension
of every object and every object has a
Transcendent Dimension it more than one
I mean it has a dimension which extends
into the past it has a dimension which
extends into the future and it has a
dimension which is orthogonal to any of
these that is the internal Horizon of
its own Transcendence now this kind of
talk is whian talk Whitehead in the 20s
and 30s actually created a philosophy a
rigorous metaphysic entirely capable of
of working in a psychedelic environment
had he written it in Sanskrit he
probably would have uh had a wider
audience but he wrote in plain English
so if you're interested in a
metaphysic of the Psychedelic experience
where you actually take it seriously and
say these things which we perceive the
dissolution of boundaries the
recombining of form the transience of
form the transience of meaning
uh the the coming together of actual
events in a real world and the
dissolution of those events into a world
of potentiality this is all uh Whitehead
type
stuff some of you may know the notion of
memes a meme is the smallest unit of an
idea it's to ideas what genes are to
biology and memes compete in the same
way that genes are competitive in an
environment a meme can be
copied I can tell you something and you
can tell someone else the a meme has
been copied a meme can be repeated I can
say the same thing over and over again
to different people who then copy it and
take it away but in the same uh sense as
a gene is only effective if it remains
uh
faithful to its original the
meme must remain faithful to its
original and the only way we can
correctly copy these memes and pass them
among ourselves is through Clarity of
understanding so there always this
pressure on Clarity nothing should be
ambiguous I don't believe in it you know
I believe that understanding passes
everywhere and that a thing is
not existentially apprehended in some
sense in until it is
understood and as far as what
understanding is it's simple it's
nothing more than the perception of
connecting
pattern so that here is a data field
could be a beach full of people or a
great Corporation or the history of
England a data
field what patterns do you perceive in
it the more patterns you perceive in it
the more you understand it and there is
no bottom to this I mean understanding
just falls through the phenomena of the
world
endlessly essentially it's about
communication that most of what we say
and do even though we may Define
ourselves as wide ranging intellectuals
