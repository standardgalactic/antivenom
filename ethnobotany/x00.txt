I I should say I guess a little bit
about myself
uh since this is sort of over the years
turned into kind of a oneman
band
um I grew up in a small town in
Colorado uh under extraordinarily
ordinary
circumstances uh and uh for some reason
I don't know genetic or something in the
water or something I was always uh very
prone to
Obsession and one Obsession gave way to
another so that rock collecting gave way
to butterflies which gave way to
rocketry which gave way to girls which
gave way to drugs which gave way to
politics on and on and on
fascinated with the world and and as a
rock Hunter and a butterfly
collector it was fairly aesthetically
driven and irrational what interested me
was the
iridescence in certain agots certain
Pirates certain tropical butterflies
certain kinds of reef fish something
about the light the visual thrill of uh
of the world and this took me through
many places by the time I was 14 years
old and read Aldis huxley's book The
Doors of perception where he gives a
very restrained and gentlemanly
description of a masculine
experience and I took it at face value
and said you know if if this
is even partially true it's
immensely important
and I began to
pursue uh this vast area of interlocking
disciplines that really has no name but
we can name the disciplines and you know
what I'm talking about botany
ethnography
chemistry DNA
function
uh cultural Dynamics
Shamanism Linguistics Theory of natural
magic relationship of man to the
environment the so forth and so on the
the the Nexus of concerns that clusters
around the question what are we where
did we come from and where are we
going and as a 14-year-old 16-year-old
when these questions first form in your
mind a reasonable response is to seek
the cultural
database surely there are answers to
these questions who are we where did we
come from and where are we going well if
you have any kind of intellectual uh
filter at all you quickly can satisfy
yourself that that our best efforts are
nothing more than half completed stories
told around the campfire
we don't actually
know what our predicament is I mean we
are up against a
phenomenon which we can barely bring
into focus in our cognitive sphere and
it's the phenomenon of our own
existence you know what does it mean
what does it mean first of all to be a
biological creature to be as an animal
what is that and then what is it to be
that embedded then in a culture with a
with histories and languages and
aesthetic cannons and literatures and
scientific uh uh hypotheses about the
cosmos and so forth and so on and my
personal Journey if you want to put it
that way lay through a successive series
of
um I almost would almost said
disappointments but Awakenings could be
another word as I realized that nobody
has their finger on what's going on
these religions that are so freighted
with their own pomposity are no better
than inspired
guesses and science Works its Miracles
by turning its ENT R into a kind of
parlor game confined to the category
matter and
energy so you can live and die inside
these intellectual
structures uh if you choose to but
people of
curiosity people of unusual or traveled
circumstance usually find themselves
unsatisfied with the conventional
