most of what we say to each other is
incredibly animalistic and lowgrade data
exchange because we're not used to
pouring the energies of cognition into
articulate speech we just tend not to do
that but actually it's at this stage of
things the closest we can get to high
hardwired uh telepathy you know honest
straight talk that draws from as deep as
it uh as it can and a search for
um well Blake said this thing see if I
can get it right he said the
truth if it is told so that it is
understood must be
believed in other words if you hear it
and you understand it and it's so you
will
automatically give allegiance to it this
is because we resonate with some kind of
ground of being that is below the
speakable and yet supporting it so the
idea here will be to try and communicate
between ourselves to create um a
slightly different kind of reality than
everybody else is hanging out
in mostly I
hope our reality will have more hope
hope than the generic reality that's
going on outside because I think that
um there are whole there's a lot of data
on the table now more information than
ever before and we can actually begin to
figure out what's going on not in terms
of the first three milliseconds of the
universe but actually
you know what is going on on this planet
what is human history what is a
cognizing species doing running around
by the billions on the surface of this
planet obsessed with religions and
driven by Vice and hatred and Visionary
longing this is
not uh what they talk about in the
biology books still less is it what they
talk about in the physical chemistry
books and something has torn loose on
the surface of this planet and we are
embedded in it and we are it and it is
sweeping us and all life on this planet
into some kind of
apotheosis some kind of [ __ ] hit the fan
situation where all the uh hopes and
dreams and fears and obsessions are
going to be held up to some kind of
transcendental inspection nothing can
stop this uh perhaps you know it could
have been stopped in the 12th century or
the 6th Century but now technical
processes population growth information
transfer destruction of the environment
we had the great dying is well
underway and the question is does this
make sense and an even more cogent
question can it be made to Mak sense in
other words can we come too in the
situation of a planet sinking into chaos
and somehow run around and punch some
buttons and close off some areas and
Salvage something can meaning be
salvaged or is the process that has gone
on over the last uh you pick a number
but it's in the billions of years
essentially meaningless dumb show and
absurdity the really freaky thing about
this I think is that it's not clear that
it seems to
rest in the domain of human
decision that the universe is not at all
what we suppose it to be and that we are
in effect presented with
a three-dimensional four-dimensional 11
dimensional Coan a Labyrinth of puzzle a
kind of conundrum which has to be cut
through and it's all done in the
mind the
whole uh apparent
world is actually uh
syntactical in nature this is what they
don't tell you uh in the philosophy
departments or the or the physics
departments that the universe is made of
words
and that there has to be a speaker and
there has to be a hearer photons quarks
antium that's not what it's about that
is a linguistic
model that floats above the Bedrock of
syntactical
connectedness that mind travels through
to create networks that it interprets
