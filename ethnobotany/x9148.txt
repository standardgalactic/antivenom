I'm not in any by any standard
sensitive so if I
get entities then they are substantial
and capable of Defending themselves it's
one of the
most challenging parts of the whole
psychedelic landscape because most
people can accept the idea of disordered
sensory input recovery of traumatic
memory material
so forth and so on but what are we to do
with an elf you know that becomes a
little harder to contextualize in
psychoanalytic theory although Yung did
a good job when he said autonomous
elements can escape from the psyches
control and present themselves as
independent
entities um I'm not sure he's ever
seen uh a self- transforming elf
machine are the those D
entities do you think yeah um I I don't
have any homogenic experience um myself
I'm more familiar with
uh Connections in nature and other
experiences that people have had
um with the pin horn group or being in
the himalia that kind of thing so I what
you're saying is through your
experiences with um um Pharmaceuticals
do you have that experience even if
you're not having it when you're
not oh it's it's the defining
characteristic of the true DMT flash I
mean it is not subtle it's these things
mob you like badly trained
Rottweilers they come bounding forward
by the dozens by the hundreds they jump
into your body they jump out of your
body
they and I've thought you know I mean it
maps to some degree over the archetype
of the little people the Leprechaun the
Fay and being Irish and being
yunan I'm willing to entertain you know
maybe I have a special uh relationship
to this stuff but then in the Amazon the
people using DMT that I studied in the
early '70s the reason they did it they
said was to to speak with the little
people uh what puzzles me about my
contacts with these beings is it
conforms to let's say the Irish model
they are small they live under Hills or
when you're with them you have a sense
that you are somehow
underground they are full of marryt
almost to a manic and frightening level
level it's sort of like a Bugs Bunny
cartoon gone
berserk they are
friendly but play rough in other words
it's a land of explosions and falling
anvils it's like a Road Runner cartoon
or something but the overwhelming
feeling
is love but I spell it luuv to
distinguish it from the ordinary kind
because it's just this kind of crazy
childish affection and they're delighted
to have me in their presence well now
that all sort of corresponds with the
Irish model or with Worldwide folklore
of little creatures little people in the
woods
and what's happening that is not
mappable onto Fairyland or leprechauns
or fin tan beings or anything like that
or anything else I've ever heard of is
that these entities have an
agenda and it's a very curious agenda
they use a language which you see you
don't you it is made out of sound in
other words it's it it is sound but you
see it in that state and the entire
point of the the encounter from their
perspective seems to be to teach you to
do this they want you to transform your
language they want you to speak
elfish and you know what if you've never
done DMT and you just smoked it and
you're 30 seconds into this experience
and it's and this is what it's come down
to uh you wonder what what to make of it
I've thought about this for years and
years and years and I don't know why
there should be an invisible syntactical
intelligence giving language lessons in
hyperspace uh but
uh that that certainly consistently
