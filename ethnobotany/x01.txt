answers and then on top of all that you
can add the fact that over the last 100
years what has come into the toolbox of
of thinking
westerners is a whole array of
Consciousness altering substances that
were not there
before and they
accelerate accentuate
the the dissolution of
sanctioned uh paradigms basically in
other words all these things you might
cling to
Catholicism democratic ideals hassidism
Marxism freudianism you know all of
these things are exposed as
simply quaint cultural artifacts painted
masks and rattles assembled by uh people
of good intent but clearly not great uh
grasp of the
situation well o over I I thought that
that
process of deconstruction of cultural
reality would end in a kind of
liberation of
cynicism where you become sort of really
Street Smart you know nobody can put
anything over on you you've been there
you've done that uh it turns out that
that existential phase which I reached
at about age
18 is itself simply a place along the
way and that persisting then with
pushing into Altered States of mind and
alien
cultures
uh I began to see
that there was
uh there was a
landscape of meaning but it was not the
meaning that I had ever been
told and this was fairly shocking to me
because part of my intellectual Journey
had been through the psychology of Carl
Young so I was very prepared for the
idea that all dreams all religious
mythologies are seamlessly connected to
each other under the surface and uh
liberalism takes the generous position
that everybody has a piece of the action
you know the Buddhists understand
something the daoists understand
something the kabalists understand
something I was getting a different
message I was getting the message that
nobody understands
anything that the
entire cultural Enterprise is 180° [ __ ]
me to the truth that we have it
absolutely ass backwards that to date
the Enterprise of thinking has moved us
radically away from understanding
anything and uh over the years I've
tried to make room for this alternative
explanation and I suppose this is the
proper place in all this to make my
standard declaimer against
squirl uh there's a lot of
squirl in this world a rising tide of it
uh some of it has been fermented not far
from where we sit this
evening
uh and I I I represent to myself and I
hope to convince you of this
radical ideas innovative ideas even
peculiar ideas but not loose or
Preposterous
ideas uh and it's sort of like as
Supreme Court Justice Douglas said of
pornography it's hard to Define but you
know it when you see it and and that
that's so as sanctioned paradigms break
down science and religion which
certainly are breaking down into that
vacuum rushes an incredibly exotic
menagerie of
intellectual uh freakery of all sorts
and so what what you have
to call into being to deal with that
situation Are Rules of Evidence tools
for telling [ __ ] from Shinola in other
words and though what I will say here
may sound peculiar none of it is beyond
the realm of
testability and none of it is riddled I
hope with uh
contradiction
so these weekends serve different
functions for different people just in
the course of doing what what I've done
