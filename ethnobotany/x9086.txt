because it is it is raid to the
Dominator insect
invasion they can't take it they can't
stand it because it empowers the
individual it dissolves the cheerful
model of science it's just exposed as
you know a nice
story it enriches the accessible
Universe tenfold h hundredfold a
thousandfold it makes the individual
complete within his or her self and this
completion of the individual is
extremely destructive to the plan of the
dominators which is that you will be a
cog and a machine you will participate
in the life of an organization not your
life the life of an organization you
will go to some [ __ ] job you will
pour the best years of your life and
your Genius and your hopes into this you
will serve an institution you will serve
serve serve serve well it's a bad idea
for free people to go along with this a
much better idea would be to insist on
the the Dignity of human beings to
recognize that the freeing of
slaves the giving of the vote to
women the ending of public
whippings that this program of political
Enlightenment must also then include
hands off on how people want to relate
to changing their
minds we are not interested in being
sexually regulated by the state and we
are not interested in being
intellectually spiritually emotionally
manipulated by the state the state
should stand down in this issue the
state is acting as the enforcing arm of
the Dominator culture specifically a
fundamentalist screw balls who you know
are horrified
by all this by the notion that people
would claim the authenticity of their
own minds that people would stand in the
light of Nature and reject original sin
and the guilt from Eden and you know the
sins of the fathers and all this rubbish
which is handed down what the archaic
revival is going to have to mean if it
has teeth is a
re-empowering of the
individual and a consequent
lowering of the of the profile of
Institutions especially
government we need to think about these
things because we have bought into the
idea that we have to serve and behave
and be enslaved else chaos will engulf
the world we need to carry out our
analysis of the situation to the point
where we can Embrace chaos and see that
chaos is the environment in which we all
Thrive that's how I've done it for years
you think I could have live you think I
could have gotten away with this in the
Soviet Union I don't think so I require
a society on the brink of social
breakdown to be able to do my work and
uh and I think a society on the brink of
social breakdown is the healthiest situ
for individuals I don't know how many of
you have ever had the privilege of being
in a society in a
pre-revolutionary situation but the
cafes stay open all night and there's
music in the streets and you can breathe
it you can feel it and you know what is
happening the Dominator is being pushed
it never succeeds it never uh it never
is able to claim itself
but on the other hand history is Young
we may have uh we may have a crack at
this a global Society is coming into
being a global Society made out of
information that was not intended to be
ours but which is ours through the
mistaken invention and distribution of
small computers the printing press all
of this stuff information is power
and information has been spilled by the
clumsy handling of the cybernetic
Revolution by the Dominator culture in
so that it is everywhere never has the
situation been more fluid never have uh
the opportunities for
infiltration Insurrection and Hell
raising been more present at hand but we
have to seize the opportunity we have to
seize the opportunity because the world
