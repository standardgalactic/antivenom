to Olive do all of these things uh
communicating to each other that is what
this large Optical system is for is to
be able to see each other the other
thing which they can do besides having
these chromator on the surface of their
skin is they can change the text texture
of the skin surface can make it rugos
populate
smooth uh uh loed rubbery Reynold so
forth and so on and then of course being
shelless
mollusks uh they can hide arms and
display certain parts of themselves and
carry on a dance well when you analyze
what is going on here it what at first
seems like merely
fascinating facts from Natural History
begins to take on a more profound uh
aspect because it is an
ontological transformation of language
that is going on in front of you note
that by being able to communicate
visually they have no need of a
conventionalized culturally reinforced
dictionary rather they uh experience
pure intent of each other without
ambiguity because each octopod can see
what is meant this is very important can
see what is meant and I think that this
Heralds or could be made to heral a
transformation in our own definitions of
language and communication what we need
is to see what we mean it's not without
consequence or implication that when we
try to communicate the notion of clarity
of speech we always shift into visual
metaphors I see what you mean he painted
a picture his description was very
colorful it means that when we intend to
indicate a lack of ambiguity and
communication we shift to visual
analogies this can in fact be
actualized and in fact this is what is
happening in the Psychedelic experience
is that we discover just under the
surface of human
biological
organization the next level in the
organization of language it's the
ability to generate
some kind of acoustical hologram that is
manipulated by linguistic intent now
don't ask me how this happens because uh
nobody knows how it happens at this
point it's magic nevertheless the fact
is it does happen you can have this
experience it represents a
sinesia in the presence of ongoing
communication it is in fact
telepathy it is not what we thought
telepathy would be which I suppose if
you're like me you imagine telepathy
would be hearing what other people
think it isn't that it's seeing what
other people
mean and them also seeing what they mean
so that once something has been
communicated both parties can walk
around it and look at it the way you
study a bruzi or a jacome in in an art
gallery by eliminating the
ambiguity of the audio signal and
substituting the
concreteness of the visual image the
membrane of
Separation that allows the fiction of
our
individuality can be temporarily
overcome you
see and the temporary overcoming of the
illusion of
individuality is a much richer notion of
ego death than the kind of white light
null states that it has imagined to be
because the overcoming of the illusion
of
individuality has uh political
consequence political
consequences the political consequences
are
uh that one can love one's
neighbor you see because the
commonality of being is
felt
felt not reasoned toward or
propagandized into or behaviorally
reinforced but felt this is why
uh the there is this persistent notion
which tracks these psychedelic compounds
