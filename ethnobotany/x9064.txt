true only for the grossest of
phenomena science has made great hay in
that
Dimension by uh creating laws which are
essentially predictive laws of cyclical
phenomena that uh Define for us what
part of
reality goes around and comes around in
other words we we can predict simple
phenomena involving the mechanical
orbits in gravitational fields we can
make simple predictions about the end
results of certain chemical processes
certain nuclear processes so forth and
so on but when you lay it against the
background of Nature and experience it
begins to look like pretty thin soup
it's no basis for claiming epistemic
preeminence and this is the point that I
want to make science claim
epistemic preeminence that means that
science doesn't say we are an ideology
like Buddhism and Daoism and the tarot
they say we are a meta system we shall
judge all other systems in our
scales well this is
politics but not good philosophy because
there is no basis for this claim to
epistemic
preeminence
so this somewhat Egghead Rave is uh
supposed to pass for a pagan pmic uh on
the uh summer solstice because it's an
attack on the foundations of Reason
itself and as you know when reason goes
uh barbarism and Madness uh cannot be
far
behind and
as a self-declared philosophical
Anarchist as in fact the founding member
of the HRI ponar Anarchist International
our motto is chaos is
order uh I believe that it's entirely
appropriate to carry out an attack on uh
reason okay so then what are we left
with well what we're left with with is
uh
intuition
intuition and what is it and how does it
work well it's a feeling into things
that comes to
answers and leaves no
Trail that's the thing it leaves no
Trail so you you you have it but you
haven't the argument for it
and so its power must reside in its uh
truthfulness so the power of intuition
lies in its ability to express truth in
contravention to the forward flow of
logic and
kazuy well is it always to be this for
you know how the Dao is presented as
this Eastern concept that you can can
barely wrap your mind around and that
hovers at the edge of intelligibility
well really in these so-called obscure
Oriental uh philosophical stances always
turn out to have a corollary in Western
thinking and the corollary to the Dao to
Daoism is intuitional ism is you know an
ability to sense the the constraints and
opportunities in the moment and act
through it
intuition and intuition is always
presented in the Dominator society as
one vague two feminine three
unreliable but this is simply because of
this bias toward deductive and inductive
systems whose falsity I have just
demonstrated to you in fact in the felt
do domain of experience called living
intuition is how most of us even the
most self-defined as non- Inu are
operating intuition is a kind of field
processing of both the foreground and
the background of experience it's a Galt
understanding that is
subliminal and that leads the whole
organism through an invisible set of
codess towards the maximizing of some
kind of a goal okay end of act one the
second uh
act um opens in the middle of the 19th
century with science
responding albeit
unconsciously to an understanding of
what I've just said the inadequacy of
reason the necessity of intuition and
yet all this going on in a domain of
Victorian gentlemen with beards to their
