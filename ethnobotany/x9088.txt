outraged some of you you were very uh
Noble about it uh civilized dialogue is
our last best hope and we must
preserve theaters and opportunities for
civilized dialogue the best idea will
win the best idea will
win thank you very
much you're listening to the Psychedelic
Salon where people are changing their
lives one thought at a
time so uh let's pause for just a moment
here and think back to what Terren said
at the end of this talk and I'm
referring uh here to his comment about
just walking away from what I guess we
would call the system let me play it for
you one more
time so this whole uh effort to bring
the Psychedelic experience back into
prominence is an effort to empower
individuals and to get them to see that
we are bled of our authenticity by
vampirish institutions that will never
of their own accord leave us alone there
must be a moment when the machinery and
the working of the Machinery becomes so
odious that people are willing to stride
forward and throw sand on the
track and uh force a
re-evaluation of the situation and it's
not not done through organizing it's not
done through Vanguard parties or cadres
of intellectual Elites it's done through
just walking away from all of that
claiming your identity claiming your
vision your being your intuition and
then acting from that without
regret cleanly without
regret we're turning final here as old
Bush Pilots say which means uh the Final
Approach before landing so uh this is
basically uh loose thread time and
summation time and uh opportunity
hopefully for some feedback from you
um what's
outstanding the uh self transforming
machine have you asked them take me to
your leader what has been the
response self- transforming machine
Nails I noticed on the internet it is
been abbreviated now to the acronym
stems and so on the vpl list there are
reports says three stems approached from
the
 
left
um take me to your leader no I did have
one DMT trip way back like maybe the
second or third or fourth way back where
it was completely different it's the
only one I've ever had like that and it
was completely different and the way I
put it to myself was the big people were
home and uh it was an entirely different
feeling and many people actually I've
never quite had this myself but many
people report DMT trips where they break
in on an entity who is not pleased at
all and demands to know how the hell you
got there and uh it's this you know who
are you and to you know then various
sorts of dialogues go on and one person
described being then just hurled through
all of time like exploded back from this
thing and going through all the
recapitulation of onogen and uh it's
weird
stuff DMP trips I mean mine are always
as I described but some people
report um and these may be synergies
with anti-depressants or something like
that but apparently very stable and
strange worlds I mean worlds with alien
people and animals and cities and um you
know very science fictiony stuff that's
why uh this Bells theorem I don't think
we use that word but this non-locality
that we talked about may have something
to do with the phenomenon of the
imagination like it's occurred to me
over the years that what we call
imagination might Simply Be
hyperdimensional perception
and you're actually
seeing uh worlds and places that truly
exist somewhere scattered through the
galaxies like grains of sand but no
place you will ever contact or visit in
the flesh but that the data is
somehow present there seems to be some
