philosophies across the entire political
religious spectrum and we're very
afraid to uh contemplate a restructuring
of societ society that would actually
restructure uh our own
authenticity when we talk about social
restructuring we see it in terms often
of planting trees in the Amazon or
getting you know figuring out a way to
get a free market happening in the
Soviet
Union doubtless all these things need to
be done but uh the uh the real real
immediate field where something can be
done is probably in our own uh in our
own behavior in our own commitment to
some kind of authentic activity that
leads out of this well so for me that
has meant trying to understand uh this
hallucinogenic plant
option because uh you know I take life
seriously as a problem I view it as a
puzzle of some sort I believe I've seen
things which cause me to believe that
it's some kind of a a
conundrum a a labyrinthine puzzle a
fitted together thing that if properly
understood will deliver one and you know
I don't know whether it's
my proclivity or my birth sign or
whatever it is but I have the faith that
this is essentially an act Act of
understanding that it is not an act of
let us say surrender or abandonment or
Fusion or it's control it's an act of
understanding that there is a a way to
break through and then say Aha and I'm
illuminated I see what it is I how could
I have not seen what it is now I see
what it is well the only thing which
comes anywhere near these places for the
Common Man are the these relationships
to these magical vegetables I mean you
can it's not satisfying to just read
meister eart and Hildegard funing and
and all these people because what their
testimony is saying is that it is a
Birthright of us all you know I mean we
shouldn't imagine ourselves as less than
the best because if you do do that you
have some kind of a losers scenario and
who wants to have a loser scenario
Robert Anton Wilson said something like
this he said he said I believe that the
power elite rules the world and I Define
the power elite as myself and my friends
if you don't Define the power elite that
way then you have a loser scenario and
who wants
that so think of yourselves as the uh
ruling Elite and Central party command
structure of the global family then act
from there I've been thinking about was
it you who asked the question about what
should we do and is there something to
be done and yeah several people ask
early on yeah well I've been thinking
about it because I wasn't entirely
satisfied with my answer and I'm not in
entirely satisfied with this answer but
here's the the state of
play it seems like what the problem is
is it's a tension between
immediacy and the desire to
plan and so I feel all these political
obligations that it doesn't seem right
to say that we should just watch the Dow
flower of the novelty wave carrias
toward the arms of the mother goddess at
the end of the Millennium when we know
that's happening
but shouldn't we do something while
we're waiting for that to happen and it
seems to me that maybe the answer is as
simple as uh this slogan which somebody
made up I don't know who you some of you
may know who this slogan uh think
globally act
locally and that we have a tendency to
want to go on Crusade because the world
is in in such a state and
but
planning is a some kind of a
demon in in a way because our whole
problem is that we planned ourselves
into this situation so instead of
feeding energy to This Global image of a
of a homeostatically regulated culture
atmosphere Fe industrial base economy so
forth and so on uh it seems like those
