went to Mexico when she was 19 and
traveled all over Mexico and took LSD in
a certain
Temple and on the LSD trip in this place
she realized that she had been conceived
there and when
she confronted her parents with it it
was so it was so that she had been
conceived there uh now of course you can
say well in growing up this must have
been a story story told around the
dinner table and then under LSD the
child brings it out but sometimes these
things just peels reality apart the
purest proof that I've ever had that
goes against the clue finding
integrative unconscious thing and really
the the time wave that we've spent so
much time looking at is in a sense a net
to Trail through life it's a
coincidental engine it causes there to
be more coincidences in your life and in
fact a way to let coincidence in your
life is to let numbers into your life uh
the schizophrenic who looks at the at
the um license plates passing on the
freeway is simply the lowest grade
worshipper of numbers but when you
really let numbers into your uh
existence coincidence runs rampant we
have talked here a little bit about the
most astonishing Coincidence of all of
all which is that
mathematics describes
nature that's a coincidence as far as I
can tell why should it no philosopher
that I have ever read no mathematician
has ever been able to make it make code
sense that the abstract operations of
the human mind should somehow map over
the uh core dynamics of nature it's like
a
coincidence um when I was working with
the time wave the most perfect
example of uh anticipation or disruption
of ordinary flows of
probability was
um I had this idea when I was working
out the time wave before the 2012 date
was chosen and settled on way back in
the early
70s I discovered an odd
coincidence which went like this it's
embedded in a whole bunch of
coincidences but it goes like
this from the date of my mother's
death till the time when I met the woman
who went with me to lot
chera 64 days passed from the time I met
that
woman till the actual experiment at L
chera 64 days
passed from then
forward 3 * 64 days later was my 23rd
birthday and looking at all these
coincidences
I propagated forward into
time uh not 64 day increments but 384
day increments and I discovered
something really interesting which was
when you went from my 23rd birthday 384
days forward no particular big deal but
when you went 384 days forward again it
landed on um the winter solstice of
1973 and I thought that this was mildly
interesting and so then I looked in a
Naval Observatory Almanac and I
discovered that U there was a total
eclipse of the sun on this
Solstice which I thought was pretty
weird and that this total eclipse of the
Sun
uh would sweep across the
Amazon would only be visible from the
Amazon basin would be approaching
totality as it swept across laera and it
would in fact achieve totality over the
city of Bim in
Brazil well now Bim is a Portuguese word
which means
Bethlehem and I began to see I began to
feel led I began to feel as though I
were being fed Clues so then I looked at
the map and you may do so as well and
you will see that the city of Bim in
Brazil the city of of Bethlehem is
situated in the Delta of the
Amazon well I'm Joyce scholar and River
freak enough to know that all Rivers are
female and if you're tooo dense to know
