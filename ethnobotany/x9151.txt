are masters of riddy and pun are
acceptable to these entities apparently
that's what they value
why I guess because they're made of
language so and and they themselves have
when I try to describe to people what
they are or what they look like various
things can be said they're
like self- dribbling jeweled
basketballs in other words they don't
have faces or anything not the little
yellow leather jerkens and the curved
pointed shoes not that dribbling self
self- dribbling jeweled basketballs and
they use the language to make objects
that's what this language how this
language is different from ordinary
English English we can make
meaning the DMT language makes objects
it's like a higher dimensional language
and so these things bound forward with
the complete purpose of delighting you
and they reach into the air into their
bodies in some into some nearby
invisible Dimension and they pull
out what I would call words
puns objects
hallucinations things which manage to be
all those things
simultaneously and they say look at this
and it's purely designed to Dazzle and
astound and then a colleague will elbow
the little guy aside and say no look at
this and they're all in front of you
chirping clamoring and these objects
that they make begin themselves to speak
and float away and
reproduce and you're you know you've
arrived 30 seconds ago you were sitting
in a room with your grubby friend
somewhere pursuing spiritual
understanding now this is going on and
it's very hard to not be horrified I
mean the cognitive dissonance the neck
snapping switch of dimensions and then
after about 3 four five minutes it
retracts it loses its uh vitality and it
begins to pull away from you almost like
a boat pulling away from a dock and in
fact I had one trip where metaphorically
not having hands they all turned and
waved and said deja vu deja vu which is
of course
absurd um now people can say say all
kinds of things they can say well this
is just the autonomous sub structures of
the psyche manifesting themselves but
sounds to me like a lawyer's
explanation yeah in light of that allow
me to extend the skeptical line just
just a bit further of your description
of the
event is it common to everyone who has
participated to your knowledge does it
represent 10% 50% 75%
are they equal in description do they
vary is this unique to your
description all good questions um it's
hard to smoke DMT especially if you're
not a smoker it's harsh some people
don't get enough I would say of the
people who smoke as much as I think you
should
smoke
75% probably report something like this
it's it's hard for people to report I
mean I've had years and years of
practice what I've just told you about
this is an incredibly crumpled
compressed edited version because what
is really happening in there is
unspeakably bizarre
unspeakably bizarre that seems in fact
to be its quality that it is unspeakable
and that therefore in order to speak of
it you have
to make a leap of faith to this higher
order
glossolalia like language um
iasa is a slow release
DMT if you deconstruct it
pharmacologically so that instead of it
happening DMT instead of it happening in
4 minutes it happens over 4 hours again
that very high dose Sasa and at very
high dose psilocybin these
entities begin to emerge when I take
psilocybon I sometime in the second hour
I pass through a
place which I've learned to
