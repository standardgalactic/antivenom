the dead is a little more Hackle raising
a little more peculiar a little more
heartful a little more hard to
assimilate and probably closer to the
mark that it is an ology of souls that's
where we go that's why they can make
objects out of language it's because it
is the flesh becoming
word and then the word becoming flesh
that this is a cycle between two
dimensions of existence and only the
shamans know what is happening because
only they operate outside the confines
of profane history only only they make
the journey into the Matrix where for
some reason the living and the dead are
co-existent well this you know just
seems like raving Madness except that
this is what every Anthropologist has
collected in his note books from every
preliterate group
worldwide there into the ancestor
not
extraterrestrials not voyagers from the
far future but the dead and it is uh it
has the Ring of truth to me this would
explain this intuition that the
psychedelics somehow have a historical
role to
play
because deny it as we may wish to we are
in a great dying it is well
Advanced so then you know there's this
sobering realization that my God what we
feared most is possibly about to happen
well then if we believe in the da if we
believe in uh the unobstructed unfolding
of things from the first moments of the
universe then what we have to do is take
hold and and face the
music and I don't think it's that bad
but I think there's a hard swallow in
the transition there is a leap into this
other
possibility so it is not simply an
opportunity for a political revolution
or a social Revolution or an ecological
Revolution it's all that it's much more
it has to do with deconstructing the
dualism of life and death
itself and creating the onos of a new
reality that is based on the presence of
Eternity that's what eternity is
eternity is the present at hand
Hyperdimension beheld and it is found to
be a domain of magic and caring and
mystery that mingles life and death as
the only possible way of overcoming the
contradiction it has
always in hindsight appalled me as I
when I go into the truly deep
psychedelic
places how casual one becomes about
death not that you seek it but that it
seems almost a trivial issue because
these two things are seen to be all of a
piece there is
continuity but there is
astonishment we do not recognize
ourselves the shaman alone has the
privileged vantage point to know what he
beholds and I think that that's how we
Define where we are on the shamanic path
do you know what you behold I mean some
people come down and
say pretty pictures other people come
down and say dancing mice
hieroglyphs do we know what we behold we
need to know what we behold because
inevitably we
become what we behold
That's all
folks well this is the third uh
opportunity that I've had to talk to the
community at these Wednesday night
lectures well I figure we have about 25
years uh before this information will be
completely assimilated into the
encroaching consumer Society the
leveling of values that seems now to be
an inevitable part of the globalizing of
society on one level it's very good when
we recognize ourselves in our enemies
and uh there's a commonality of
values generated but on another level
it's
tremendously destructive of uh novelty
and uniqueness I mean we're turning the
the whole planet into a whitebred mall
shopping culture and uh the values of
