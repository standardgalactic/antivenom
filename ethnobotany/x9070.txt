year that every four years we have to
add a year to keep it okay but how many
of you knew that uh every Century year
divisible by
400 is also a leap year even if it
occurs out of sequence the year 2000
will be such a leap year it is a century
year divisible by 400 so was
1,600 and so in that case you have a
leap year even though the previous or
the following year may be a leap year so
there is a fudge factor in the high and
mighty solar paternal calendar that
keeps it on track well uh somewhat
factiously what I propose at least as a
thought model is an entirely different
year length
384
days now 384 days is an interesting
number it's 13
lunations precisely 13
lunations and uh so we would have
therefore a need for a 13th month in the
calendar and I propose that the 13th
month follow August And precede
September and be called
remember and the month of remember will
be a month of great pneumonic
celebration and recovery of the past it
will be a celebration of the past well
okay now we have 13 months that's
wonderful but we have purchased this
13th month at the expense of 19 days
that overshoot the solar year what about
that well instead of viewing that as a
problem as it has always been viewed
let's view it as an opportunity what
happens if you use a day length 19 days
longer than the solar year Well it means
that the great festivals of the solar
year Easter Christmas the 4th of
July will let's call it independent day
so we don't confuse ourselves cuz it's
going to move that these great
festivals uh will do what is called
press each year they will come 19 days
later against the solar year than the
year before so in such a calendrical
system you would be as a child Christmas
would occur let us say in Winter by the
time you were in your middle teens
Christmas Christmas would be occurring
in
springtime by the time you were in your
mid 20s Christmas would be occurring in
high summer and in your mid TW uh 30s it
would occur again it would occur in
Autumn and through a life of 60 or 70
years the solar festivals would migrate
through the seasons well this may seem
trivial to you and hey it may
be but uh
the the psychology of it is that it's
trying to build in at the highest level
a truth which we have lost sight of
which is the idea that everything
flows that everything is
impermanent that flux is the
only
uh standard flux is the only thing you
can depend
on if we gave ourselves permission at
the highest and deepest psychological
level the place where we measure time
and the spectacle of our life as spread
out against the grid of the history that
we live through if we were to give that
permission to be portrayed on a grid
that emphasized flow
transcience change and recurs ion rather
than this constipated solar Square
against the fixed stars then what we are
really doing you see is changing
archetypes we are changing archetypes
and what are we changing we're changing
the apollonian solar paternalistic
Dominator archetype for the feminine
Oceanic
intuitive giving and taking King
archetype of flow and life and death and
completion through change rather than
completion which seeks to Stave off
change and then is inevitably swept away
and therefore somehow touched with
pathos well maybe that's enough um maybe
there are questions uh this was somewhat
Meandering I'll recap it for for you to
try and give you the illusion that there
was a
plan
