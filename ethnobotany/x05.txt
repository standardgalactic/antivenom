what sheld calls the morphogenetic field
what is novelty novelty is
self-explanatory
it's what breaks the pattern new
connections new possibilities and the
universe is in a state of dynamic
tension between these two Tendencies
novelty surges forward new art movements
new technologies new inventions new uh
social mores new classes and
then habit reasserts itself close the
theaters kill the Jews reestablish the
old order and this goes on over and over
and over again but the good news is this
is not a manakan struggle this is not an
eternal
struggle novelty is
winning novelty is winning inch by inch
iot by iot over millions and billions of
years the universe grows more
novel more connected different
temperature regimes new forms of
physical new domains of physical law
because at first the universe was very
hot you couldn't have organic
chemistry uh you couldn't have uh
societies well now if if
novelty is a sense in a sense what I've
described to you is what we could call a
novelty conserving engine the universe
is a novelty consuming conserving engine
it produces novelty and then it acts to
hang on to it and it uses that novelty
to build the next level of novelty so
upon matter it builds longchain polymers
DNA a mo it builds organic molecular
structure upon that animal life is
organized upon that complex sensient
higher animals upon that technology
using humans and upon that the global
society that we live in well now notice
something interesting has happened by
making
novelty our our uh value to be cons
served suddenly the human
Enterprise is not
peripheral suddenly the human Enterprise
is what it's all
about the cosmos has been moving its
eggs closer and closer to one basket for
eons you know the action is not now in
uh uh the Brites or the kants or the
reptiles the action now is in a single
species of primate all of Nature has
halted its activity to turn and watch as
homo sapien sapien the double thinking
monkey takes the stage and begins to
work with novelty on a scale like
nothing that has ever been seen before
and this this tool building function and
I use the word tool in the broadest
possible sense language
is a tool uh social organization is a
tool but this is what we do we build
tools and mcluen very wisely observed
these tools are extensions of who we are
they are only distinct from us in our
opinion but in fact they represent
extensions of our humans and
now well for some time let's say
Obviously for about 10,000 years
something really weird has been going
on uh because before that time had an
entirely different character even in the
era when there were people using fire
and practicing rituals and chipping
Stone my God the monotony of it I mean
try to imagine uh 10,000 years
where what happens is you go from
flaking on one side to flaking on both
sides and this is hailed in the
archaeological record as a staggering
cultural advance I mean we're talking
major boredom on one level about 10,000
years
ago it began to
Quicken and people moved into cities and
they began to elaborate specialized and
social forms so forth and so on
well then about a hundred years ago this
went through an order of magnitude of
acceleration and about 15 years ago it
underwent another order of magnitude of
acceleration so we are now living in an
entirely different kind of time uh our
cultural toolkit is being replaced
approximately every 18 months uh it
there was a time when it was not
replaced every 18,000 years what do you
mean our cultural
