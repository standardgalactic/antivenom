take an idea like what I just said and
amass evidence for and against it and
try to then cure ourselves in a way I'm
I'm trying to carry out a kind of yungan
analysis where we realize that we are
all the children of some kind of very
damaging thing which happened in prehist
history and it's plain as the nose on
your face it's just that we are so
traumatized we do not see it I mean look
at the the story of Eden which is the
central datam the central mytholog of
our culture it's a story of uh substance
abuse and the consequent punishment that
follows upon that because Eve
eats of the fruit of the tree of life
and it says in Genesis if they eat of
this fruit they will be as we are in
other words it was specifically the
issue of Consciousness expansion and
yahwa the jealous God the volcano God of
a paternal of a of a dominator culture
and said no you're not coming into that
inner sanctum but she had eaten of it
anyway so there was a parting of the
ways well this parting of the
ways I believe is a metaphorical
description of the breakup of the
symbiosis in Africa and the fall into
profane time the the uh withdrawal of
the
uh the bride really I mean in in
alchemical terms or in terms of the of
the Yan marriage of the anima and the
Animus and uh we are now I think in a
position to uh at least talk about this
as a possibility
because this thing which was driving
these religions on the plains of Africa
was uh a tryptamine hallucinogen it was
specifically a mushroom which was
occurring in the uh the dung of the most
of the early cattle that were just at
that stage being domesticated
well the experience which that mushroom
induces in US is no less
overwhelming and
transcendental and
incomprehensible than it was to those
people 15,000 years ago we have nothing
up on them in fact we may be in a worse
position
to understand it because our language is
now carrying a thousand a millennial
long Legacy of paternalistic
egocentric uh materialistic and
empirical biases they may have possessed
languages that far better commanded the
true modalities of the transcendental
object than do our
languages so the archaic revival is uh
an invitation
to historical Humanity to view itself as
a kind of prodigal sun and to
abandon the the wandering in history the
paragr in history and to return to the
archaic fold with what has been learned
and what I will suggest to you that has
been learned is uh the
purification and uh and uh rational
analysis of the uh scanon of the whole
shtick which is the helicogenic
compounds in other words human history
is a dipping into matter a kind of
fatian um PCT to Come Away with what the
shamans of the of archaic times were
approaching by a natural
means well let's see means I've talked
for about an hour are there
questions uh yes I'd like to uh hear you
talk a little bit more about language in
words um I read somewhere I can't
remember exactly
where if silence is a reality then all
words is intrusions
lie and and when you said that reality
is made up of words and yet it seems to
me aren't you talking about rather than
you talking about
it yes well that's a good question um my
brother said a funny thing one time he
said uh has anybody noticed that as you
expand the sphere of understanding the
surface area of ignorance necessarily
grows
larger so there is this Paradox that as
we understand there becomes more and
more that we don't
know uh I
uh what I am interested in and it may
