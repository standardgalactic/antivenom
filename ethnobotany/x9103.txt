uh social or sexual style we have
monogamous human societies polygamous
societies this is very different from
animals we have poetry we have
mathematics we have drama a whole
spectrum of effects that is far from
anything that we find in animal
organization and this problem has
fascinated me for a long long time as
it's fascinated a lot of
people uh because obviously it's a great
embarrassment to the theory of
evolution that it can't account for
human
consciousness because after all human
consciousness produced the theory of
evolution so you see it's a significant
failure
there
so uh obviously if you accept the basic
rules of The evolutionary game which are
that there is random mutation which
means Gene drift mixing of genes through
sexual
reproduction uh cosmic rays which cause
birth defects and mutations this sort of
thing and natural
selection and these two factors natural
selection and uh and mut
are sufficient to account for praying
mantises Chipmunks tropical rainforest
but not us and the reason is that we
emerge too quickly from the background
of the rest of ordinary
nature uh in the space of about two
billion years the human brain doubled in
size and lumholtz who is an Orthodox
evolutionary biologist calls this uh the
most dramatic
transformation of the of a major organ
of a higher animal in the entire history
of life and it happened to us it
happened to that very organ that is
responsible for the theory of evolution
so what extraordinary
Confluence of um factors could have come
together there to take a
a essentially an arboreal monkey an ape
of some sort that had been at an
evolutionary climax in the canopy of the
rainforest for a couple of million years
what extraordinary set of
factors could then set that creature
marching down the road
toward you know Elvis the internet Bill
Clinton and uh all the rest of it well
you would imagine or I imagined when I
first started thinking about this that
there must be some huge edifice of
established theory that we have to go up
in there and blow up surely somebody has
has staked out this ground and made some
kind of an argument about human
consciousness well in terms of science
not or almost not I mean in terms of
religion it's simple I mean God made us
from the clay of the Earth in terms of
science the best shot is pretty weak
soup from my point of view here's here's
what science is telling us
that when you throw
something you have to
plan because once you let go of whatever
it is you're throwing you can no longer
control it and so because we were small
and weak and hunted in packs we learned
to throw like hell at very large
onrushing woolly uh fellow mammals of
various sorts and you had to plan your
throw consequently we develop brain
capacity to do this and have had enough
left over to invent quantum physics
paint the Mona Lisa invent the fanatic
alphabet philosophy religion and all the
rest of it uh in other words it was the
coordination of the hand and the eye to
the throwing arm this is what the
Orthodox folks tell us that gave us this
extra brain capacity that we sort of
then managed into human civilization
well notice that this would make the
Pinnacle of the EV evolutionary ladder
uh the gum chewing big league baseball
pitcher because you know he can put that
pill right across the plate at high
speed uh Time After
Time as somebody who learned everything
they know about sedom masochism in PE
class I'm not really ready to embrace uh
this Theory it it definitely runs
