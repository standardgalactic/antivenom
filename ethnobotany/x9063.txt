induction an
induction for those who believe in it is
thought to be without without doubt a
superior form of reasoning to
deduction because it leads to a control
and a manipulation of real consequences
in the world okay what is induction and
how it works and how does it work well
it works like this
um when I hit the water with a shovel it
makes a
splash every time time I hit the water
with the shovel it makes a splash
therefore this is the leap the therefore
therefore shovels can be used to make
water splash now notice what is
interesting about this in in contrast to
deduction is that there is no untested
first principle you don't State
something and then reason from it you
make make repetitious
observations and then those observations
which are most repetitious you raise to
the status of
laws
induction and this
uh was abhorent to philosophical
thinkers because it doesn't have this
Aristotelian Purity that deduction has
it doesn't have this mathematical
Elegance it's messy it's all down in the
world observing and comparing and
repeating experimentally procedures but
nevertheless out of inductive reasoning
comes the structure of modern
science okay
uh but now there's a funny thing about
induction it's making an unstated
assumption about time
it is making the assumption that time is
invariant because what is it is saying
is if a precedes b in a thousand
cases then it is likely that a will
precede B in the Thousand first case in
other words it's a probabilistic theory
it assumes that probabilistic laws give
momentum to repetitious observation now
the question is is this so and the
answer is well it's so in some cases but
not in the most interesting cases the
most interesting cases I believe are the
cases which lie in the realm of primary
experience of being the felt experience
of being and in that realm the realm of
love affairs divorces lawsuits religions
political upheavals and that sort of
thing induction is no good guide at all
one love affair does not explain another
one marriage does not illuminate another
one revolution really does not shed
light on another there may be
generalizations but when you live
through these things what you take from
them is uh the
uniqueness of the
experience the first principles that are
reasoned from in uh
deduction whether in the realm of a uh
deductive mathematical system like uid
or a rational theology these things are
seen to rest on foundations of sand
because of this problem of the
Axiom in
mathematics the a AUM appears fairly
secure because it's it's
self-evident such as parallel lines
never meet it is it's it rests on its
self-evidence to make its appeal to
reason you see you can see that it is
true though no one has ever figured out
how to prove this you can see that it is
true but when you move from the realm of
axioms to the realm of uh theological
first principles the appeal then is not
at all to the obviousness of it but to
the desirability of it that God exists
that God loves us we hope these things
are true but they are certainly not
self-evident in the scheme of things
from the point of view of most of us so
what this shows then I think think is
that in the matter of deeper
things deductive reasoning rests only on
the appeal that hope can lend to its
case Okay so for me this is a critique
of
deduction now what about
induction I referred to the fact that
its premises rest on this notion of
temporal invariance which seems to be
