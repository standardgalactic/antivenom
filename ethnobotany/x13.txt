Philip Deval some of you may know him
and he is a lover of animals so this guy
has made a fortune in publishing books
on reptile care and if you have a broken
iguana he's the man to to see but he
pointed out something to me very very
interesting which goes against
prevailing political correctness for
sure which is that browsing ulet animals
have absolutely no interest in the
behavior of other animals they couldn't
give a hoot whose interested in the
behavior of other animals are hunting
animals and that in in order to
successfully hunt an animal you must in
a sense be able to become it you must be
able to transfer your Consciousness into
it and imagine its motivations its
behaviors so forth and so on and so
Philipe has convinced me that on one
level the earliest human consciousness
was not human consciousness at all it
was primate ability to enter into the
Behavior patterns and
psychologies of uh other mammals in the
grassland environment that it was
predating upon uh following
vultures as a basis for the beginning of
nomadism and this sort of thing
obviously Predator animals are
aware and their evolutionary success is
based on environmental awareness and
being able to uh act on based on
inputting the behavior of other animals
this is a very complex mental world
compared to the world of the fruitarian
leaf eaing canopy
browser uh that we came from and then it
appears you know that in a series of
coalescing involutions of culture and
neural
organization driven by uh
the spatial Coincidence of human beings
cattle
mushrooms uh our original primate
programming was
restructured and I've talked a great
deal about this I think this is the key
to understanding at least our sexual
politics all primates have what are
called dominance hierarchy
and this is where the hardbodied sharp
fanged males young males arrange
everybody else to suit themselves the
elderly the sexually available females
the young homosexuals the sick everybody
gets told where to stand and what to do
this is how primates operate this is how
we
operate however I think that for a long
period in human beings beings this was
interrupted by uh nutritional factors
and Drug factors in the environment that
in a sense a human society that is using
psilocybin on even a lunar cycle of use
is suppressing the ordinary pattern of
male dominance hierarchical dominance
it's not genetically touching it
it's still there but in the same way
that if you give a population of
aggressive people a lot of opium
aggression disappears if you give a
population of people a kind of
psychedelic boundary dissolving
aphrodesiac that promotes group bonding
and erodes monogamy and so forth then
you get a different social Ambiance than
if that weren't present and I think the
secret to understanding our curious
relationship to the Angelic and animal
worlds has to do with the fact that
under the influence of this hormone SL
enzyme which was suppressing ordinary
patterns of male dominance Consciousness
underwent an extraordinary series of
bifurcations and
language
theater poetry Magic
religion
dance music ethical values
altruism
everything emerged you know sometime
between
35,000 and 10,000 years ago the
Paleolithic the pre-agricultural
era uh an
extraordinary uh period of novelty being
uh expressed and conserved in the
biological world the primate species the
hominids suddenly just take the stage
