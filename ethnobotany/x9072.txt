understanding that uh the problem was an
illusion it was an
illusion it was the last
illusion what is what what in your
position is uh the effect of no my uh
what what has happened to our society do
you think by virtue by we have the
obvious Cooperative evolutionary process
about us
everywhere and yet we don't have a
myth what will happen to us if we don't
get a
myth well we do have a myth we just
don't call it that I mean our myth is
the fatian myth that uh reason can ring
the secrets from nature and thereby make
man a God and this is the myth of modern
science
uh all of the alchemical dreams of the
16th century transformation of matter uh
prolongation of life so forth and so on
have been achieved by 20th century
science uh the problem is that our
myth is a fatal one that's what I'm
saying where's a myth that fits the
evolutionary concept that you're I hear
the calendar as a myth would fit yes
well this is what we do what happens to
us if we don't get one well what happens
to us if we don't get one is we just
drive this bcle right over the
cliff in the next uh in the next 40 or
50
years uh the the myth that is trying to
be born in science and it has to be born
there because that's the dominant Church
the myth that is trying to be born in
science is The Rebirth of the
spirit the spirit has been banished from
science and not that long don't don't
think that it's been that long as late
as the early 20th century there were
people like
d in Germany who were
embryologists who were looking at the
morphogenesis of form and they said
there must be what they called the Ilan
vital there had to be a vital spark
there had to be a indestructible
something there well then of course DNA
came along to explain that no no it
isn't that at all it's just these
proteins are uncoded and so forth but
um Spirit has never really died in
certain branches of biology and
psychology you see there are problems
for science the chief problem is this
one that I can hold out my hand that I
can tell you that I'm going to close it
and that this
happens what you see is mind over matter
what you see is free will you see mind
willing matter to behave
and it happens within the confines of
the body Paranormal Activity appears to
be going on nobody none of these Hot
Shots can explain how you can conceive
of turning your hand into a fist and
cause it to happen right there is the
defeat of 2,000 years of rational
scientific
philosophy and they just say yes that's
right but we make great fighter
planes so
um I see uh rert sheldrake is very
important in the process of building a
new scientific myth because what he is
saying is on one level completely
outlandish on another level he completes
a program that has been going on since
the
1850s tonight I talked about biology and
evolution but there were parallel events
in the 19th century going on in the
field of the study of magnetism and
electricity and people like Faraday and
Helm Holtz and James Clerk Maxwell were
discovering
Fields well fields are
extremely
um sort of metaphysical phenomena I mean
they are
invisible they pervade all space uh they
can't be seen and yet instruments can be
seen to detect them and not only that we
can transmit music and voice hundreds of
miles right now this room is
interpenetrated by hundreds and hundreds
of longdistance telephone calls high
frequency radio Transmissions high
