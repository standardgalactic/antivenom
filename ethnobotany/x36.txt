you to perform some
unimaginable task that is somehow caught
up with the unravel of the space-time
Continuum and the destiny of the species
and so forth and so on and you know this
is a 30 seconds into a trip that lasts a
minute and a half and then you're
returned to you know you and your
friends and your
concerns um
LSD is not
animated in this way it it is more
like uh the classical expectation people
have I think who have not taken these
things of what a psychedelic drug should
be in other
words you think clearer you see
connections you can hold very complex
ideas in your mind and rotate them and
look at them from many angles you
experience emotional abreactions you
recover childhood memories you are able
to straighten your karma out with people
you are undergoing rapid
psychological uh growth uh under the
influence of LSD but it it doesn't T the
the reason I am not so keen on LSD is
that I'm really a plant guy not a drug
guy and it's it's something about these
substances that have been carried along
in the genomes of these plants for in
some cases hundreds of millions of years
and why you know what are these things
doing for the plants and then what how
can a molecule so simple this is another
puzzle in all of this these molecules
are planer that means they're flat
they're simple sometimes 20 30 atoms
and yet uh they totally transform your
entire
Consciousness this is the equivalent of
a red ant who can rip down the Empire
State Building in an hour and a half I
mean why is mind so delicately poised
that such a tiny amount of
pharmaceutical material can create such
vast changes and then another puzzle as
long as I'm listing my favorite mystery
and this is the one that really got me
into this in the beginning because my
early
inclination was toward art history and
that is a very simple
question where do the images come from
where does this stuff come from I mean
it is so
unref to the ocean of commercially
produced imagery in which we swim you
know we are constantly bombarded by the
the images of television and Hollywood
and so forth and so on and yet the
Psychedelic species of visual beauty is
not we don't see it in our furniture
Styles and our architecture it seems to
be coming in literally From Another
Dimension and yet it is
undeniably moving it's
beautiful and I I am puzzled why I as an
ordinary person
under the influence of let us say 30 mg
of
psilocybin can see more art in an hour
than Western Civilization has produced
in the past thousand
years and that tells you how little of
we're getting from the art River back to
the village where we can drink it niagar
of beauty are flowing by untapped by
ordinary consciousness
and you know uh would that we could send
robots who could film these psychedelic
realities perhaps you know virtual
reality will develop into a technology
where we are able finally to reconstruct
and agree upon the content of the
Psychedelic experience but to me that's
almost like the metaphysical stamp of
approval on the Psychedelic experience
beauty is an the the Pres of so much
beauty is an argument to me that truth
cannot be far away yeah are you aware of
any spontaneous trips
uh
without um the
plants well you know there's a whole
vast area of human endeavor called
mystical religion and there's a whole
other vast area of human endeavor called
madness and uh uh many stories abound
and come out of these areas um I I think
