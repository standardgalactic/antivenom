for 8 hours doing anything well it's
amazing to
me
um the basic notion here I I think is an
idea of radical freedom I mean this is
not a cult of Terrence McKenna it is not
a drug cult it's a cult of curiosity if
it's a cult of anything and what you're
supposed to understand when you come out
of here that an open mind is a very
precious thing and it should never be
given away perhaps ever certainly never
lightly the truth can take care of
itself it do not require your belief the
truth need not be treated as fragile you
can beat on the truth with ballpen
hammers and it will do just fine thank
you so it one should be respectful in
the presence of truth but not
um cow or
OD or something like that the truth
wants to be appreci iated it wants to be
known it can take care of itself belief
is toxic all belief don't believe in
anything live in the presence of the
felt fact of immediate
experience everything beyond that is
conjecture uh in contemporary Society
we're always in the past and in the
future but what is real are feelings and
feelings attain a Nexus only in the
moment only in the moment so uh you know
explore the
edges keep your logical razors sharp
trust nothing that you haven't verified
for yourself and um my faith is that the
universe will uh take you in and share
with you its meaning
and its intent and uh its
conclusion so that's it thank you very
much it was a pleasure talking to
 
you can you hear everybody can
hear
good well I like to lead with good news
so so uh let me assure you that at no
point this evening will I read from or
quote the poet
roomi uh it's a pleasure to be in
Sacramento it's a pleasure to be in
California I lived here for about 30
years before moving out about 8 months
ago lived over in
ocidental so I sort of feel like this is
a
HomeTown
congregation you may have seen the story
in the bee this morning uh it was a
reasonable detailing of my theory of
evolution I noticed that one expert
wouldn't even give his name to allow his
no comment to have
[Laughter]
attribution gentlemen this is no way to
behave in the face of an ideological
Revolution anyway um and plus it isn't
even my weirdest idea
um but that that was left unmentioned
thankfully in the
article but since the article dealt so
specifically with Evolution and because
that probably is my best candidate for
entree into any any kind of
respectability something I crave
intensely in every atom of my body I
thought I would uh discuss it with you
this evening and try and make it seem a
little less
absurd than
uh than my critics might make it seem
first of all let me lay out for you the
uh the nature of the problem right now
the nature of the problem is finding the
damn phone and shutting it
off no the nature of the problem
is that
uh evolutionary theory tells us that we
are some kind of
advanced animal of some sort and science
has waged a noble struggle over the past
150 years to secure this position
against all attacks by Orthodox
religious thinking and yet there
is after it's all said and done the
sense that if we are an animal we are a
very very peculiar sort of animal indeed
a unique animal an animal capable of
language and coordinated
planning an animal not bound to a
particular
