he said something that you might be
interested in and brought out a samp Le
of dimethyl tryptamine that he had
somehow come into contact with and and I
said well what is it and he said well
it's this short acting it's a flash he
said and I
said you know how long does it
last that was my first mistake they said
oh it doesn't last long so I said okay
we'll do it and we did it and and uh I
discovered I had I guess it's called a
peak experience or a core Revelation or
being born again or having your third
eye opened or
something which was it was a
revelation of an alien
dimension of a brightly lit
inhabited non threedimensional
self-
contorting
sustained organic linguistically
intending
modality that couldn't be stopped or
held back or denied I mean I sank to the
floor I couldn't move and uh and uh this
D systolic hallucination of tumbling
forward into these fractal geometric
spaces made of light and then I found
found myself in the uh sort of oric
equivalent of the Pope's private chapel
and uh and there were insect elf
machines uh profer strange uh little
tablets with strange writing on them and
I was a Gass completely appalled because
it the transition had been a matter of
seconds and my entire
expectation of the nature of the world
was just being shredded in front of me
I've never actually gotten over

it and
um and uh you know me it all went on I
mean they were speaking in some kind of
there were these these these self-
transforming machine elf creatures were
speaking in some kind of colored
language which condensed into these
rotating machines that were like
fabri eggs but crafted out of
luminescent superconducting Ceramics and
liquid Crystal gels and all this stuff
was just so weird and so alien and so un
English that I felt like it was some a
complete shock I mean the literal
turning inside out of the intellectual
universe and I had come to
this fair I thought fairly
intellectually
prepared uh you know I mean a kid but
nevertheless double Scorpio art history
major herous Bosch fan Mobi dick William
Burrows you
know and and it was uh as I came down
and this this went on for like 2 or 3
minutes this situation of discontin
orthogonal Dimensions to reality just
engulfing me and then as I came out of
it and the room sort of reassembled
itself I said I can't believe
it it's
impossible it's
impossible that I mean to call that a
drug is
ridiculous I mean it just means that you
just don't know you just don't have a
word for it and so you putter around and
you come up on this very sloppy concept
of something goes into your body and
there's a chain it's not like that it's
like being struck by noetic
lightning and the other thing about it
which astonished me was there is no clue
in this world you know in the carpets of
Central Asia in the myths of the mayia
in the visions of an arolo or a
Frangelico or a BOS there is not a hint
not a clue not an atom of the presence
of this thing and when you look at the
religious heropon of the human
species uh it doesn't have the same Vibe
it doesn't have the same charge religion
is all about dissolving into unitary
States of uh of love and uh
translinguistic
Oceanic unity and this sort of think
this was not like that this was more
multiplic than the universe that we
share with each other it was almost like
uh the victory of neoplatonic
