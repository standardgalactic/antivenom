force will maximize and then very
suddenly Plum it and that's called
breaking the sound barrier and you're
through it's very clear that this
culture is revving up to
attempt the leap into
hyperspace and it's either going to
succeed and we will become
unrecognizable to ourselves and Scatter
through the Galaxy as Moes of light
or uh we will fail and probably biology
will cancel the R&D division on
intelligent life and go back to ground
squirrels Chipmunks and monarch
butterflies that's worked so well for so
long yeah understand a little bit the
physics idea of you know um matter uh
seeking some sort of organization and
then seeking a disorganization kind of
the the back and forth EV and flow and
makes me wonder about computers and the
internet and the worldwide web how now
we're trying to structure ourselves in a
in something that seems to be going
against the human grain and why do you
think it goes against the human
grain well it's artificial it's um well
we invented
artificiality I mean I don't disagree
with you I somebody pointed something
out to me recently I find very
interesting they pointed out that in a
cubic inch of forest soil there's about
uh 11,000 miles of mycelial
wiring now we're building something
called the internet and furiously laying
copper and fiber optic everywhere and
soon it will go Wireless I think that
this net that we're building is not the
most artificial construction ever
conceived it's a Similac of
nature is what it is nature is the
original internet I mean nature is some
kind of
interconnected
communicating data routing
self-regulating non-equilibrium system
and as we go nanotech as we descend to
the molecular level our teachers are
going to be plants
viruses bacteria they know how to do it
down there and we don't and I think that
the artificial phase of technology is
simply that a phase remember in
um Arthur C Clark's book the city of the
and the stars the central dictum of that
society and it had been a rule followed
for a million years was no machine shall
have any moving
part and uh that's coming and those are
machines we can barely imagine and they
will be you know smaller than a Nat's
eyelash so uh the artificial natural
thing seems to me a synthetic dualism in
fact all dualisms are synthetic because
at least in my book there is a there is
some kind of neoplatonic one that lies
behind all the
Lesser understandings that give us
category well I think you know what
nature teaches and what life
teaches is that worry is
preposterous worry is a form of egom
mania because in order to worry you have
to assume you understand the
situation what are the odds that you
actually do understand the situation
very low I would think and the more
abstract the worry you know I'm worrying
about you know ratam ladich and he's
running around free over there in a
country I've never seen now is this a
sane thing for me to be worrying about I
I don't think so uh worry is
preposterous and how I've understood
that is I'm not a fatalist or a
predestination person
predestination is preposterous because
if the world is absolutely predestined
then you think what you think because
you couldn't think anything else that
makes The Quest For Truth somewhat
pointless in order for there to be truth
there has to be error uh otherwise how
would we know truth so uh
uh well that's probably enough on that
yeah I think maybe the last couple of
comments and now my own are are positing
a third way which is not the technique
of these um aesthetic practices in
