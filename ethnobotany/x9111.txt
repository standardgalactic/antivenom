and Thomas Hobs and all those folks
fixed it up for us in the 18th century
Thomas Jefferson ironed out the wrinkles
and modern America is the shining
example of uh what you can do if you
empower the ego the citizen the
individual we want nothing of tribalism
still less of collectivism and God
forbid nothing whatsoever to do with
Communism see all these all these things
uh set us going um but in
fact the ego is appropriate only to a
certain point I mean yes we need OS so
that when you take someone to dinner at
a reasonable restaurant you Place food
in your mouth not their mouth this is
this is what the ego is for it tells you
who
pays
um but in fact what the ego is is the
return to consciousness of this psychic
structure related to the patterns of
dominance and the way I think of the ego
is it's like a cyst or a calcarius
growth or a tumor that gets going in the
personality and if not
treated it becomes chronic and then
there is no cure there can only be you
know a certain amount of Maintenance and
uh medication of it but it's it's
incurable
except unless we resort to not only
nonprescription drugs but uh drugs
current ly illegal in other words the
psychedelics through this boundary
dissolving function dissolve that
boundary as well and so they promote a
larger sense of the world than the
values of uh capitalism
competitiveness object
fetishism property acquisition and the
bottom line
ower
so the the issue as was always sensed
since the60s forward I think is not
simply a an issue of religious freedom
or an issue of an eccentric minority
social practice being tolerated by uh
the majority the way they
tolerate handing out pamphlets in
airports or something like that the the
issue is in fact what kind of of people
shall we be and then what kind of
society shall we put in place and that's
why my theory of evolution is not simply
a
dry footnote on a an issue that involves
Anthropologist primatologists and
biologists but it turns into a
political issue
because our unhappy addicted ego
driven condition has become not simply
the source of our own unhappiness that
was bad enough but now it's the source
of great discomfort and dislocation for
all life and Human Society on the
planet we we are out of
control we are
basically severely addicted to
things and cannot stop
ourselves uh and we know or we should
know that there is not enough petroleum
heavy metal so forth and so on in the
planet to give all the thing addicts all
the things that we know they must have
in order to be happy we have spread this
intellectual virus from pole to pole to
turkistan and barneo to the upper Amazon
and to the tajiks everybody wants kids
you know everybody wants the Paw that
refreshes
uh what are we going to do about this
well so far we've been treating it like
an endless Garden Party there's no
serious plan on the able to deal with
this at all uh uh I I think that the
momentum of human history is pushing us
inexorably toward some kind of Day of
Reckoning and in which we are either
going to have to turn
consciously toward brutality and
selfishness and say well let India go
let Bangladesh go Triad
costs too much can't possibly fix the
problem in order to maintain our locked
compounds and our 50 channels of
television and the endless availability
of arugula we have to let uh India
go we're going to have to turn that way
in other words each consciously
