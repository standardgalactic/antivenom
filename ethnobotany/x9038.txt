basis of poetry an understanding reality
was attention to the minute particulars
so there is a way of
opening Beyond symbols Beyond
language and we
have we call it realism but but we don't
recognize it for what it is I mean
realism is thought of as another
ISM but it isn't another ISM it's an
onos of a completely different order
there are isms and there is
realism and realism seeks to go beyond
isms to go beyond language to go beyond
expectation and the forward moving net
of language and to present us with
something which is you know shocking and
infinitely deep and Beyond
contention this is the thing and so um
this thing has been carried forward
mostly in art mostly as an intuition
it's not clear to me that it's ever been
exactly articulated as a philosophy but
this is what the light of
Caravaggio and uh you know the recept
professional distances of the brothers
vanik and you know Turner and all of
this stuff it's a going into the stuff
of the world without preconception
attempting you know the Great Discovery
that Shadows are not always black you
know somebody had to look to to figure
that out and then to uh embody it
against the flow of all understanding
the discovery of
perspective is this peculiar episode in
the history of Western thought that is
never discussed sufficiently we are
asked to believe that somewhere between
the death of jotto and the death of
Michelangelo European human beings
suddenly
understood that things got smaller the
further away from you they were and
therefore cre the world of pictorial
space that we have inhabited ever since
well
um you know in an earlier lecture I told
the story about how Thomas
aquinus proved his sanctity by being
able to look at open books and then
later tell what he had read without ever
moving his lips this was silent reading
and it was viewed as a miracle by his
contemporaries because they all had to
vocalize while they read well um this is
a similar kind of phenomenon this sudden
popping into existence of the
recessional distance and the whole set
of understandings that allows us to
navigate three-dimensional space what is
happening here does language Make Way
for this stuff is it biological is it
just happen to happen during the Italian
Renaissance how can a Convention of
painters of a courtly class become a way
of inhabiting space and time for the
entire population of an ancient
continent it's it's defies understanding
what is actually being tracked is some
kind of recent
Readjustment of the uh information
processing values in the human human
brain mind system and these things are
very close to the surface and very
easily perturbed uh you know Julian
James in his book about the bamal
Mind felt that uh there had been a major
shift in the construction of
Consciousness at the time of Homer
that uh before Homer people didn't
exactly have
egos they were sort of like uh soulless
beings which when put under pressure by
like a tight situation in battle would
have a magical voice speak to them in
their head and tell them what to do and
they called this their demon their
familiar their titulary animal or God
and that and then he felt that this
autonomous function of the psyche later
became
incorporated into the larger structure
of the human mind as the ego and that
what we use as an ego was once a god
this is the depths to which we have
fallen that we you know have have uh
Shackled a god into the service of
uh managing our
portfolios you know in it's a principle
that's very old in nature for instance
