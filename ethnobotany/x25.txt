that weekend than in the previous 30
years of being interested in flying
saucers and I was you know read all the
books all the special cases I knew the
data and all that but I had never hung
out with flying saucer people and it was
so
obviously a private Idaho that I just
couldn't wait to get away and I I I
think I don't know there are two
impulses in the human psyche I mean at
least two in this case and I am just I
just don't resonate with
Believers in anything I mean I I get in
I get insulting to Buddhists for God's
sake I mean it's just something about
their smugness and their whole bit that
just brings I just want to squash it so
you can imagine how I behave in the
presence of scientologists and and the
rest of it
uh belief is is um it's again it's a
form of
infantilism uh there is no grounds for
believing anything and uh uh the Flying
Saucer thing I went to this conference
imagining that what I would meet would
be a whole bunch of really interesting
sincere people who wanted to discuss uh
the phenomenon of
unexplained things in the sky and
contacting human beings and what I found
was you know Booth after Booth of people
who had all the
answers all the answers learn how a
nearby Planet reduced crime by
500% I got news for you not even God can
reduce crime by 500% once you've reduced
it 100% you've got it
[Laughter]
so I so you know this was the quality of
thinking that was going on and then
there were a lot of really scary people
in brown leather shoes with thin smiles
and and cheap suits who were clearly
Third Rate uh semi-retired intelligence
hacks who were there to keep the flock
headed in the right direction
and uh you know people wanted to talk
about experiments on human fetal tissue
that go on in underground Laboratories
out in Arizona through the connivance of
the CIA and the padian high command and
you're just thinking uh well I've got to
call my broker I'll get back to you on
that I mean I I don't know I have
I to
me if you can't well
it's an aesthetic thing it's an
aesthetic thing I believe that great
weirdness stalks the universe that's not
the issue with me but it's not
tacky it is not
tacky and people who wear low cut gowns
with a lot of sequins on them and Tiaras
and pass out uh Flying Saucer shaped
business cards that's
tacky and and so it can't be so I I know
this I've never been wrong if if
intelligence fails Aesthetics will pull
you through this is what and you know
people don't like this part of me I I'm
I don't make it comfortable for other
squirrels I don't share the branch very
uh very
generously
um you know a place where I've gotten
into lots of trouble is with the face on
Mars I mean I just have not got enough
unpleasant things to say about the the
face on Mars everybody connected with it
the very idea I mean talk about an
something which should never have been
let out of the box that's it I mean the
idea of a chachka 17 by 11 miles in size
just gives me the heie jeebies uh I
don't want to know those aliens they
should go back where they came from and
take their chachka with them we need
people who can build in light and
balance planetary
ecologies and uh do really cool things
massive Earth moving projects is we've
been there we've done
that you never went to the moon
either you know books will appear on
these these subjects one of the
interesting things about UFOs experience
though and and the other kinds of
phenomena that you're talking about is
