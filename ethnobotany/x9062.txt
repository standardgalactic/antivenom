that it's not a tough Ro to hole and
maybe it's not for everybody in maybe we
are misguided to seek to expand our
Circle larger I mean maybe what we
should seek to do is to deepen the
experience and connections within our
Circle this is another way to do it you
know human beings don't believe in
anything unless it's a mass movement but
when it's something from the heart maybe
the real authentication of it comes from
a deeper personal
commitment
well why don't we knock off for
today the first thing I wanted to talk
about was uh because the winter because
the summer solstice is a great Pagan
celebration and because I think we
self-consciously celebrate it with the
sense that we are participating in
something which goes slightly against
the grain of the Dominator culture in
which we're embedded and because that
culture has made a paragon of reason I
thought it might be fun tonight to just
talk a little bit about uh about reason
and
intuition and the forms and the politics
that attend each so let me dig into this
a little and think
aloud reason which is uh always held up
as the path to True
understanding has two
forms they are called deduction and
induction and all forms of Reason can be
subsumed under these two
types now deduction which is considered
the stronger form of reason is called
reasoning from first principle
and it works like
this you start from an idea which cannot
be
proven you accept it as given and you
reason outward from it an example that
is familiar to all of us would be uh
ukids elements of plain
geometry you start with what appears to
be an incontrovertible truth or what we
agree appears to be an incontrovertible
truth in the case of uclid propositions
such as parallel lines never
cross never
meet well uh you can imagine a railroad
in your head and run your mind along it
to infinity and then you've inspected
the infinite Railroad and lo and behold
it no point did the rails cross so you
accept this as true then you can reason
from it now in the case of the ukian
proposition that uh parallel lines don't
meet you test the truth of it by
carrying out this imaginary inspection
of the items involved and verifying that
the statement appears true in all cases
that you can
imagine but other forms of other
branches of human knowledge
also use
deduction interestingly enough
theology
theology so theology reasons like in the
following
manner God
exists this is perhaps not Christian
theology this is a generic
theology God exists because Christian
theology would seek to go further back
and prove in some cases such as in
scholasticism that God exists but let's
just start with the given assumption
that God exists and then a second
assumption and God loves
us given these two
assumptions then deduction goes to work
and elaborates an explanation for why we
are not with God God how we can get to
God and so forth and so on so deduction
is useful notice that my two examples
have been drawn from in the case of uid
mathematics in the case of uh the second
case from theology a branch of uh
philosophy so deduction seems to have an
important role in these abstract systems
but remember I said it was one of two
forms of reasoning that are ordinarily
dealt with now the second form of
reasoning is to my mind more
interesting the second form of reasoning
is
induction not deduction
