I mean the drug is opening and you are
opening and there is a dimension of
recognition about which it's rather
difficult to say very
much uh and the third
criteria in thinking about the
possibility of substances as a as a tool
for spiritual growth is uh does it have
a history of human usage does it have a
long history of human usage that's in a
way the most important of all no
synthetic has a history of a long
history of human usage and most things
with a long history of human usage will
turn out to come from a plant so what
you need is you know all these people
who went
before they
proved that uh substances like
psilocybin eogan harmaline
masculine uh the the experience of the
human community over time proves that
these things do not
cause um birth defects
miscarriages tumors blindness Madness
ulcers so forth and so on in other words
uh in since we are not allowed to
legally investigate anything since we
are not allowed protocol calls for human
investigation of anything old or new
than really the only human data uh
available is ethnographic data data on
obscure Amazonian tribes and uh uh
rituals conducted in the Mexican
Highlands well to my mind it isn't I'm
I'm not an advocate of drugs I'm an
advocate of psychedelics um drugs that
are not
psychedelic interest me approximately as
much as I assume they interest everybody
else I mean I sometimes do them certain
ones I abuse caffeine most notably I
can't abuse alcohol because I'm a
migraineur but uh the Psychedelic thing
is a special category and a special
political issue I read a book recently I
said mentioned this to some of you by um
Arnold trebeck who's one of these Think
Tank East Coast type policy
formulating consultant to the government
type characters and clearly a good guy
on our side advocating
legalization and meeting the objections
to the legalization of hard narcotics
with a number of interesting arguments
the book is like over 600 pages long
well when you look in the index there's
nothing about LSD nothing about
psychedelics nothing about MDMA
psilocybin DMT DPT aain STP none of
this apparently they're choosing to
pretend that the issue of psychedelic
therapy and the issue of the spiritual
Dimension that is accessible through
plant chemistry it's too much even for
the Liberals to hand
they they don't even want to talk about
it they want to reluctantly announce
that they have lost the war on drugs and
then with great hand ringing legalize
these things with the sense that now
this surely will trigger the end of
Western Civilization as we know it there
is no sense of a dimension of Hope
opportunity clinical breakthrough
nothing like that yeah yes the question
is language and uh the fact that uh how
does what I said about language relate
to what I've said previously about the
DMT State and why is it that some people
come back speechless from these
Dimensions I'm glad you asked this
question probably not because I'm going
to answer it but because it reminds me
of something in a way it's answering
I I see language as an uncompleted
program language is something which
wants to be
beheld but is only
heard and so there is this tension you
recall I said a few days ago that after
many
grapplings with the
DMT uh ecstasis that I had the feeling
that uh
the place you break into there is a U
play pan it's an environment created by
someone very strange who has a very
curious notion of human
psychology and it is an environment that
