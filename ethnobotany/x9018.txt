and stood a while in thought and as in
oish thought he stood the jabber walk
with eyes of flame came woing through
the tulgey wood and
burbled as it
came one two one two and through and
through his vpal blade went Snicker
snack he left it dead and with its head
he went gumping
back and hast thou slain the
jabberwock come to my arms my Beamish
boy oh frous day Kalo C he chortled in
his
Joy it was
brilling and the slyy toes did JY and
gimble in the
wave all Mimsy were the
boros and the mour wraths out
grave that's worth hours of the other
stuff
well I hope I assume most of you
recognize that as Lewis Carroll's jabber
Walky which was uh uh an example of uh
verbal intentionality and syntax
overcoming absence of ascribed meaning
this is what's happening here that the
intentionality of meaning is so great
that it overcomes the absence of uh
conventional
definition and uh we've been talking a
lot in this uh section about uh language
and the origin of language and we've
also been using language in a fairly uh
free and in some cases unusual and in
some cases outrageous manner
so that's what I meant when I said it
made sense to examine the
tools um we are
particularly
neurologically
outfitted for the production of small
mouth
noises rapidly modulated small mouth
noises we can do this I've proved it
myself for hours at a time without
exhaustion and what is going on there is
that rather than the Rippling of
plumage or uh the rubbing of hard body
parts against each other since we don't
have any hard body parts to rub against
each other most of the time uh
Communication in our species has taken
the form of neural modulation of small
mouth noises
now these small mouth noises are
transduced into acoustical waves a
physical phenomenon which moves from
point to point in ordinary Newtonian
space the acoustical pressure wave
strikes the
ear the ear conveys the uh particular
unique signature of that arriving
acoustical wave into for what of a lack
of a better term we have to call the
mind and the mind takes this acoustical
signal and Compares it with an imprinted
dictionary built up out of experience it
does this very very quickly the speed
with which the dictionary is consulted
and each arriving word is identified
it's syntactical class understood and
it's uh it's uh intentionality in the
domain of meaning recognized is very
very rapid it represents the most rapid
sort of intellectual activity that we
undertake as human
beings thought is a similar phenomenon
but it is an interior dialogue and God
help us let's hope we understand our
thoughts better than what people say to
us because in the case of our thoughts
we are both both the uh the one
communicating and the one communicated
to
language is this double-edged
adaptation of the human animal it is
obviously a
uh
multifaceted
multi-purpose adaptive advantage in all
environmental situations because if you
can image and linguis Ally process
evolving situations you have a leg up
over an organism which is hardwired for
reaction along the line of
instincts yet in the domain of
cognition it's almost as though language
has exceeded its usefulness because
someone said language was invented to
lie well perhaps that is too cynical but
