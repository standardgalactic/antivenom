uh magical Attunement with what wants to
be this is what I think Kay must have
been indicating this is not language
this is
communication this is you know the
breath
of The Da and everything that we say
betrays this so
funu geomancy an elaborate theory about
energy flowing through the Earth as a
verbal
model to me quite
unconvincing as a set of feelings about
the world as a sense of the
intentionality of place
incontrovertibly
true you know I said earlier maybe we
lie maybe language is to allow us to lie
that language betrays
communication well then we have to find
our way into either silence or gesture
or
dance or uh
song Some Way of unbridled the horse we
ride so that it can take us where it
wants to go which is back
into this place where ego isn't grabbing
because you see it must be so that if
the magic Retreats from each one of us
in the wilderness how much more than it
must Retreat from us as a community on
mass as a planetary species so we live
in a domain of triviality that we we
have created you know we have
trivialized the world the elves the
fairies the water Sprites uh the
energies that flow in the Earth with the
seasons the movement of the Stars the
Machinery of being the the drama of life
and
death we push all this away and we hold
ourselves above it I mean death is
sanitized birth is sanitized IED
everything is made less authentic as
though we are somehow threatened by the
authenticity of being why are we
threatened by the authenticity of being
uh why does it take such tremendously
powerful hallucinogenic agents to put us
where we should be operating in terms of
our pattern of caring for the world and
for each other
and this is a real question I think uh
it it goes hand inand with the question
that I think is very worthwhile for the
group to try and deal with which
is if psychedelics are so
wonderful are we better
people and if they are wonderful and
we're not better people then why
not what is what precisely is our
relationship to people who know nothing
of this
uh is this a way is it the way is it no
way at all
how how does the mystical
Vision feed back into how we are with
and for each other are we doing enough
with that are we um you know do we
exemplify enough what we know and what
we feel and if we don't how can we
because this is our faith I believe that
we have something
precious that we want
to give to those who are operating
without awareness of it but before you
give something away you know you have to
wonder after the consequences I don't
have answers to this and this is what
this is the question that should hover
over our lives do we
embody um the radiant
correctness of what we say we are uh
pursuing I certainly feel that I am a
flawed and fragile vessel for this I
mean my my strength is my ordinary it
must be it's the only suit I can play so
that must have been the idea you know
that it would be Joe anybody but how can
we uh make it live for ourselves and
this is a problem with the evolution of
language the evolution of communication
of caring of intent and then of uh of
implementing the vision I don't know
maybe I'm impatient maybe it's happening
and maybe
the awareness of the changing Earth the
awareness of the needs of the Earth the
awareness of the needs of women uh the
awareness of social injustice generally
