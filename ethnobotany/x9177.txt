here in the
1960s and now we're back to today we're
descending ending this thing so
basically what you're looking at is the
'90s with the present year in the m in
the middle and it shows that this is by
the way predicted to be the most
dramatic year in the decade and that
that dramatic whatever that drama is
it'll be in full play by
June wise grab Taiwan by the
Chinese or it could be an AIDS cure
or it could be an ebola
outbreak uh I wouldn't look to the
American presidential election for much
excitement unless uh there's Gunplay
which never rule it out in this country
uh uh we play rough uh there could be a
scientific breakthrough of some sort
this this planet detection thing is
obviously edging toward explosion
because there is a water heavy oxygen
rich world out there within 50 light
years and the technology to detect it is
now
99% in place and it's just a matter of
you know teasing it out of this
hellaciously difficult data but we're
going to know you know recently the
Hubble Space Telescope discovered uh the
other 80% of the galaxies in the UN
ierse so we now have instead of 10
million G billion galaxies uh in one
press release we go to 50 billion
galaxies that means five times as much
intelligence five times as many
civilizations and you know that's page
42 news in uh the New York Times uh
rejection just no it's funny people say
well what will happen after 2012 well
you haven't been listening this Theory
doesn't say anything about what happens
after 2012 this is a theory about what
happens before
2012 that's why waiting to TW till 2012
to use it will be rather self-defeating
because it won't work after
2012 of course if there isn't after 2012
it will be wrong in which case we will
have the Curious task on our hands uh
some of us of figuring out why it seemed
right for so long yes it became 67 years
old
yes um
I I've never heard of anybody having an
experience quite like this I mean it's
hard for you probably to appreciate who
I am because I appear fully in command
of this but I am not interested
particularly in eaching I'm not a
mathematician don't like uh predestiny
or the it's just not my style this whole
thing uh I'm a rationalist and somewhat
cynical left to my own devices perhaps a
little dark uh this is an incredible
argument for some kind of hope it says
there is an architecture to time it says
the Wars the rapes the
horrible revisions that go on are part
of the pattern and all will eventually
find resolution in the final uh
culmination uh and then you know the
question which I would put to the
mushroom or the logos or whoever it is
is if this is not true then
what possible
purpose could all this have served I
mean what's it for I don't mind the
Public Disgrace of being wrong but it'll
humble me but we didn't probably need to
mobilize a mass movement to Humble me so
so what was it all for and I confess I
really I I don't know I I have ideas I
mean any question like that as long as
I've been thinking on it will be answers
I mean how about this suppose um the
unconscious is a kind of
regulatory has a kind of regulatory
function and uh of Hysteria of mass
hysteria and that what this prophecy
made by me made by the Maya made by
these vadic people what it's for is to
smear expect ations about the
Millennium so that instead of having it
all focus on January 1
200000 there'll be
denters there'll be people who say well
it isn't January 1 2000 haven't you
heard it's
2012 and so then a huge number of people
