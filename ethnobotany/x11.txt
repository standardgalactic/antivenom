of
do-it-yourself courageous Psychotherapy
it was a personal
voy it is only if you don't take it
seriously if you take it seriously then
it this is not your personal stuff this
is the stuff and that's how
shaman approach it you know they
wouldn't be able to conceive of what you
mean by a personal Vision I mean there
are only visions and if if psychedelics
are on any level to be taken seriously
as catalyzers or expanders of
Consciousness then we need them because
it's an absence of Consciousness that is
making this historical transition so
excruciating and to the degree that we
can raise Consciousness our own and
other people's we can go through this
without a lot of yelling and hollering
but people who do not understand what's
going on and their numbers will multiply
as the chaos spreads are going to
require a great deal of of
reassurance well on that thought I'll
send you to bed um let's get together
tomorrow morning here at 10 a.m. thank
you all very much it's a good group I'm
happy to be
 
here I'm not very keen on the whole
abduction
stick I think that uh one of the
symptoms of cultural
disintegration is simply that people
lose the ability to distinguish between
uh dream and memory
a a and that somehow one's past one's
real past and one's dream
past simply become one's
past and then under certain
circumstances you know what was
basically dream material is presented as
reality you know just because you have a
nut Theory it doesn't mean that you
agree with other nut
theories in fact it it makes you very
hostile to them after all there's a
limited pool there that we're
all my whole Mo my idea with
psychedelics at throughout my whole
career with them was that they were the
purpose was to go out into mind space
and hunt
ideas and uh
bring something back to show the folks
around the campfire something that would
astonish and amaze us all well you know
it's a narrow Keyhole the mind you can't
uh you can't bring back a flower like
the time traveler does in Well's story
uh but so I found the only thing I could
bring back not being graphically endowed
was
ideas it's a very mysterious business
the the revelation of
uh uh to mind of the
world since the last time I talked to
any audience I I finally understood an
argument of my enemies that I had never
understood before enemies in the in the
friendly collegial ideological sense in
other words and
enemies
uh the counterveiling theory to the
evolution of Consciousness how it came
to be so rapidly as opposed to the idea
that it was stimulated by psychedelic
compounds in the early human diet was
and I've ridiculed this idea to you
before the idea that uh human beings
throw things and because we were small
small and weak and we hunted very large
animals we learned to hurl rocks with
great accuracy and that this is a
behavior not observed in the animal
world I mean monkeys hurl feces in a
generally downward direction to indicate
displeasure but their aim is lousy uh
which is a very fortunate thing if
you're an Amazon
Explorer uh but human beings can hit
with with considerable Force an object
up to 120 ft away and uh evolutionary
biologists have fastened on this as
uh requiring so much coordination of
neural material that there would be
enough left over to invent western
civilization and explore the planets
once you had this uh this thing down
