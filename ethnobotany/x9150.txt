psychedelics and once you've encountered
these things
you have to take them
seriously uh to the point of you have to
understand where do they fit into the
great order of being what are these
things How can there be a life form not
made of matter in other words how can
they be intelligent and coherent but
have no fixed body
outline uh are
they is the universe in fact populated
by nonhuman
non-material intelligences that we
somehow contact using drugs I mean
that's one
possibility that's an the question yes
where are they when you're not there uh
is it an ongoing thing are
they is something going on on this
planet are these the controllers are you
getting into a back channel that you're
not weren't cleared for uh uh or
and this is to my mind the most chilling
and appalling and exhilarating
possibility of
all when you go back over the Shamanism
thing you say you know you shamans now
where is this all coming from they will
tell you it comes from
ancestors well that's a cheerful and
fairly sanitized concept but when you
deconstruct it ancestors are dead
people what is actually being suggested
there is that there is a kind of ecology
of souls one energy threshold over that
is co-present with this
world well strangely enough that's what
the Irish myth of the Fay says says
these are dead people these are souls
that linger in our environment and this
is what Souls look like
um again folklore is only a guide but if
what we are dabbling with if what lies
at the end of the road of shamanism is
the dissolution of the boundary between
life and death itself then the million
year intuition that this was a path
worth following will be
dramatically Vindicated and one of the
reasons I've preached DMT
so furiously is I just want a larger
body of people to take it so that we can
compare dat
uh we need to understand you know how is
this possible it raises a whole host of
questions one is not only how is this
possible but then given that is this
possible how has it been kept
secret how can uh millions of people go
to the Grave raise children hold jobs so
forth and so on go to the grave and the
news of a doorway a standing that a gape
hasn't penetrated I mean most people
believe they're
imprison in this world and that the only
hope is maybe 15 years at the ashram and
hideous acts of
self-abnegation and control and so forth
and so on and actually the boundary
between us and an unspeakably bizarre
world it's 30 seconds away at at any
time as long as you have DMT available
to smoke that's appalling to me I mean
it means we don't know nothing yeah uh
you talked about trying to map your
experiences onto the um myths wonder if
it's possible that you could look at the
myths for information of Mastery that is
we've no longer masters of this doorway
we're trying to ReDiscover a Mastery
that's been held for thousands of years
maybe there's something we can find in
the midst that tell us a behavior or a
mode of being in that state that would
be useful for instance catching the
leprechaun and getting the pot of gold
implies there some kind of game we can
play with them that yields some value
yeah well the classical myth about
leprechauns is that they want to keep
you if they catch you they or if you
mess with them they'll hold you and then
you have to bargain your way out and the
bargain is always the solution of a
riddle notice that What's Happening Here
is it's all about linguistic prowess
it's it's all about poetic skill it's
all about language ability only the
eloquent only the clever only those who
