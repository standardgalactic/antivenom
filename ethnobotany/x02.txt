with my scene I know a lot about
plants and uh anthropological use of
psychoactives and chemistry and
anecdotal stuff and I'm very happy to
share all that with you right down to
recipes and how to do it because I
that's very important to empower
people's personal toolkits and
Technology
uh at first I had great enthusiasm for
that part of the teaching process
because I felt I was alone in trying to
get people to take high doses of
psychedelics and pay attention you know
that this was not a party experience
this was something at the edge of
metaphysical profundity it now appears
that psychedelic exploration is Alive
and Well in sh Ed in the culture as a 3%
minority to be tolerated approximately
with the same level of Toleration
granted to Advanced SNM
practitioners so so that has been taken
care of and and so what interests me
more now is for me what all these years
of psychedelic taking came to was a new
model of how reality Works a new model
of what the world is and several people
in going around the circle referred to
it tonight as the time wave or or talk
about time and the Ching I represent
a remember when we were kids or it still
continues today but there is a genre of
cartoon of the bearded corpulent man in
the robe carrying a sign which says
something usually the is near and repent
well how a rationalist a platonist and
admirer of all kinds of evidentiary
veracity could find their way into that
position I don't know but that is the
position I'm in I really am quite
convinced I I wouldn't say
100% but that what we are experiencing
here at the end of the 20th century
which we call chaos or cultural speed up
or
globalization or you know just the
concatenation of multiple social crises
is in fact something far more
profound than a mere crisis in our
politics or our management styles or
something like that that
the it is that
the cultural world the world of human
culture and his history is reaching some
kind of
climax at the same moment that the
biological evolutionary process which
has been working on this planet for 4
billion years is also reaching a
climax and both of these simultaneous
trajectory toward breakthrough are
occurring in a yet larger context where
the very laws of physics itself are
undergoing some kind of a
local uh phase shift or
transformation and I am completely aware
of how nutty this sounds at first I mean
any problem you have with this I had in
Spades uh first of all all apocalyptic
theory always centers on a moment not
far in the future there's never been any
percentage in saying the Earth is going
to end in 50,000 years uh you there's
just no juice in that uh nevertheless
when you begin
comparing ontologies you got to always
remember this is not a freefor all uh
are only a certain number of
intellectual products on the market uh
what is science
selling science is selling the idea that
some time ago for no reason the Earth
sprang from nothing in a single
moment well now whatever you may think
about that idea notice that it's the
limit case for
credulity do you understand what I mean
I mean whether it's true or not it's the
most outlandish explanation for reality
possible for the human mind to conceive
of and that's step one with science so
what does this do what is the
consequence of this scientific
worldview a progressive
marginalization and
de-emphasis on what it means to be a
human
being because the universe is enormous
in space and time our galaxy is utterly
