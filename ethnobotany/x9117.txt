what it's like when a species departs
for for the Stars it's it's a birthing
it's
complicated um if you had never seen a
human birth and you came around the
corner of a building in your daily round
and it was happening it vibrates medical
emergency I mean blood is being shed
tissues stretched it doesn't it you
really have to have your chops together
to step back and say how wonderful New
Life coming into the
world because uh you know that's not the
vibe of it and I think that's the circum
cumstance that we're in this is the
birth canal to a new order and at the
moment it looks like Suffocation
constriction
limitation possible death but uh we need
to inform
ourselves and get a big
perspective and there's no way to get a
big perspective like education and
psychedelic experiences if we could
see history for what it is it's a it's a
25,000 year nearly instantaneous
transition from one state of being to
another and yes there are 1,500
generations of people who live in
that paper thin transition time but when
it's over it's over and we will leave
history behind the way you dump a used
placent
I'm sure yeah wonder is there any
reliable information on the relationship
between psychedelics and early
Christianity reliable information on
psychedelic use in early
Christianity the answer is no I mean
there there is a book by John Allegro
called The Sacred mushroom and the cross
he was a very respected Dead Sea scholar
till he wrote that book
uh and that basically finished his
career as a classicist he says some
incredibly provocative things in that
book to judge whether he's right or
wrong you would have to be an Assyrian
philologist about which I know nothing
so to the lay person it seemed to be
quite an impressive book but apparently
to his specialist colleagues it was
sloppy thinking and a travesty and
reason to deny
tenure
um St Augustine was uh a
monist before he no he was a
manakan before he converted to
Christianity and uh he mentions that
manans forbade the use of mushrooms the
eating of mushrooms it doesn't say the
use of mushrooms
but the ancient Middle East we don't
know very much about sa psychedelic
sacramentalism it may have been there uh
it may not have been there absence of
reference is not proof of absence
because of cult secrecy and and other
factors like that we do know that the or
or we feel we're on firmer ground in
saying that the Greek mystery religions
emphatically probably were psychedelic
especially the the elisian Mysteries the
Mysteries which were practiced on the
plane outside of Athens every year for
over 2,000 years and everybody who was
anybody in the ancient world made the
journey to elus to celebrate the greater
Mysteries which were celebrated in
September interesting approach to
psychedelics there you could only
legitimately participate in the mystery
at elus once in your
life so imagine if you had a single high
do psychedelic experience under ideal
conditions in other words in darkness
under the care of experts and then the
rest of your life you had to sort it all
out based on what happened that one
evening it was extraordinary
powerful for the ancient world
eventually it was destroyed Aller the
visigoth who was a barbarian but that
didn't stop him from being a convert to
Christianity uh Aller the visigoth
burned
ausus on his way to North Africa to burn
other
things yeah I was wondering Terrence if
you'd had a chance to read the emperor's
