is ringing like a bell and that the main
power of oscillation is around 10 Herz
which is um uh happens to be the alpha
rhythm in the human brain and he's
postulated that in some cases brains can
phase lock to the geomagnetic field and
that the geomagnetic field oscillations
can serve as a kind of a carrier
frequency to bind these cortical uh
resonances basically together for brief
periods of time
and has speculated that this might be
the source for ESP like activity are you
familiar with that that theory yeah I he
wrote a wonderful book called SpaceTime
transience and unusual
events uh he's been very creative
with using the electromagnetic field as
an explanation for all kinds of things
and I'm totally open-minded to that his
work is very interesting it does seem to
be true that along earthquake faults you
do get piso electric buildup and release
and uh you know the world is full of
bizarre phenomena some of you may have
seen in science news last week for the
first time they have confirmed these
enormous blue and red lights above
75,000 ft in the atmosphere airline
pilots have been seeing these things for
years nobody there was no Theory nobody
knew knew what they were now NASA
dedicated an expedition uh one of their
aircraft to looking at this and they got
thousands of images of these things and
it's an electrical phenomenon Theory
doesn't account for and nobody knows
what it means um I'm on one level I'm
sympathetic to Pinger and and any and
that approach to explaining some of
these things and I do think the place
has been overlooked
in importance on another level I I've
it's this is a very hard thing to talk
about um but there is
like what I call linguistic
viruses which infect the effort to
communicate and they're very hard to
catch at work
so and and it has to do with how can
people believe things which are
absurd and it's very interesting to
spend time with people who believe that
things are something which is absurd and
it's I you know a lot of people bring
wraps to me that they want confirmation
or disconfirmation on and
uh I me I passed this way last night
when I talked about the Rules of
Evidence the the standard of discourse
has decayed to the point where it's very
hard to get uh any kind of consensus
about anything because most people
participating don't know how the game is
played and uh linguistic
viruses really are responsible for much
more of reality than we
suppose uh I suppose I can't really talk
about this without stepping on
somebody's toes so let me let me pick a
now for
example uh crop
circles crop circles are
important and uh what was going on at
the England end was uh these things were
uh absurd I mean you had only to see one
to understand what was going on and and
to see that a a confluence Nu of British
eccentricity ripe
grain uh a certain Ambiance in the air
was allowing these things to come into
being and then the the media was Fanning
it into existence well now how does this
work uh talking of coupled oscillators
and and Pinger and all
that pardon me would you repeat that law
oh that the the the Paranormal
phenomenon has an impact in an inverse
Square relationship to the distance you
are from the
event you see because here's how it
works the media is reporting the
onrushing phenomenon of existence stock
markets Wars diplomatic meetings
gangster killings so forth and so on
then something weird happens now I have
a job you have a job we note that
something weird has happened but it
doesn't affect us but scattered through
the society there are people who when
