past 500 years uh just shows me that we
don't want to go into that with the mind
because anything can be taboo your
genitals don't have to be taboo your
mind could be taboo anything could be
taboo but the presence of the
taboo is so destructive and alienating
and so makes community so
impossible that uh we have to take
individual men and women and we have to
make them
free that has that is the the system
where Freedom has to be maximized I
don't say that we have to convert these
people to the existence of magic in fact
we don't have to convert them to
anything the the nature of the
Beast meaning the nature of these
hallucinogens will set the agenda once
we are free to
inquire that's all freedom of
inquiry well
on one level you're right the laws are
totally
irrelevant we ignore them so does
everyone else
uh you mean we worry about
them styles of taking and styles of
getting
together
yeah well this is like the same question
about sexuality or automobiles or
anything uh
obviously though we say all people are
created equal we don't sell guns to
8-year olds and this sort of thing
um but within the context of reasonable
people attempting to reach reasonable
positions I think this should be as free
as possible I I think there should be an
institution for handling it you see if
we were a primitive or a preliterate
society there would be
shamans who would be professionals and
they would the would take out the
adolescent boys and the adolescent girls
and put them through
ceremonies that would inculcate them
into the secret life and belief systems
of the tribe and then certain ones would
be selected out to be the shamans of the
next gener
generation we don't have any kind of
institution like that part of my
motivation for a public career is the
belief that that Psychotherapy could be
this the motivation behind psycho
therapy is entirely correct but how can
we make it real you know uh Shamanism
does this you see I'm not
I wouldn't go to a
shaman for a cure if I had
um
carcinoma or something like that I
regard them as most effective in the
realm of mental problems psychological
conditions this is why when ethnobotany
got started the first things that are
looked at are the psychoactive plants
because if someone if a shaman tells you
this will cause you to see Visions he's
probably correct but if he tells you
this will uh cure a
disease this is less certainly so
because the concept of curing disease is
a more Western notion the concept of
restoring neurotic imbalance seems to be
pretty generalized worldwide I think
that
uh if you're interested in drugs the
first stop is the library and it's a
long stop and you educate
yourself this all seems very natural to
me this is how I did it and how all my
friends did it uh in the early 1960s
there were articles in newspapers about
morning glory seeds and this kind of
thing we we followed up and learned how
to use scientific literature to figure
out dosages and all of this kind of
thing uh for
me I mean I take drugs
seriously so I also don't want I'm
perfectly aware of their capacity to
cause a problem so you want to be
educated you want to have all the
information so people number one have to
be educated and then they have to be
given the freedom to decide now
inevitably certain people
