improbability in other words uh it it's
almost as though the biological control
which is exerted on this mamalian
species by the mushroom is
actually at the materialistic level a
control of who has children by whom
which means the control of the evolution
of Gene lines I maintain this is why the
place most people feel magic in their
own lives even the most
humdrum people feel magic in their lives
is in the matter of mate
selection because you know uh I was just
down in the BS and heard a story this
morning where a man said you know I had
a happy marriage for 7 years it was
perfect and I I run a some kind of a
company and one day I got a telephone
call someone wanted to sell me a new
line of nails and I knew when I heard
the voice on the other end that my
marriage was ruined and that I would
follow this voice and possess this woman
and so forth and so on which he had done
for better or worse well this kind of
thing where the most stayed lives can be
skewed off in other directions is uh you
know in the old style of talking about
it it's an eruption of the
unconscious but where psychedelics are
involved it seems to be more a winnowing
of uh of the genes so sex obviously has
this um deep
complex multi meaning kind of uh feel
about it that uh pretty much the rest of
reality for most people doesn't I
think uh the next step in my own
Evolution and I feel like I am simply
the fortunate beneficiary of a series of
random events which were very fortuitous
from my own point of view in other words
that without having a whole lot of sense
and with very little foresight I very
fortunately found myself in a lot of
right places at a lot of right times and
the place I went after
adolescence was uh political
awareness and the discovery of what it
meant you know the goggle eyed kid had
conquered or at least had had a brush
with the feminine but then the next
great item on the agenda was the
community and I was uh in Berkeley for
the street Uprising in
1968 and learned what A revolution is
not what it is from the point of view of
the history books or the 11:00 news but
what it feels like what it actually
feels like to take and hold
a a place that's been denied you against
the
state and uh what this what I learned
from that I think is that one of the
core elements of this psychedelic thing
is
freedom on the broadest scale I mean it
truly is and you will hear me use this
phrase over and over again boundary
dissolving and that's almost for me
synonymous with freedom this is what we
want to do we want to dissolve
boundaries between the rich and the poor
the feminine and the masculine the
living and the dead all boundaries do
dissolve in the Psychedelic experience
and the social metaphor that captures
this is
revolution revolution is an eruption
from the unconscious it is not a reason
able thing it has a logic of its own
it's as though the overmind reaches down
into the mechanics of political process
and says no it won't be that way it will
be this way and uh you
know as you watch this thing in China
unfold the the the revolution that I
went through was Child's Play but the
Revolution going on in China is about
Consciousness I mean God the notion that
you know people were selling John
Stewart Mill in Translation in TI men
square like hot cakes brings a tear to
your eye I mean it just uh it's
incredible and as I said on Friday this
the Psychedelic Dimension lies directly
ahead of us it is permission for
cognition permission for Revolution and
resolution
of the uh
contradictions that have emerged out of
