meaningfully that's what's really going
on
so looking at this situation years and
years ago knowing and feeling what I've
essentially just said to you 25 years
ago I
um I've always been a skeptic I mean
I've always been a sort of on a downer
cynical even and take things apart and
belittle them and see how they tick it's
just a it's a male rational style uh
scientific
style and the Assumption behind that is
that you can reduce the whole world to
something which is
nonthreatening and neutral
somehow but um a weird thing happened on
the way to completing this program which
was um
I discovered
something which it is my intention to
try and share with you I don't know
it's many people have made this
discovery but I can only speak uh for
myself so for me it had a very intense
and uh kind of transformative
immediacy and this was I discovered that
in the realm of the so-called
transcendental I was raised uh Roman
Catholic and in the process of cutting
that loose switched to Latin for
Sanskrit for a while and
uh you know I've I've had a lifelong
interest in the transcendental but
basically from a debunking point of view
in other words not for me sweeping up at
the ashram not for me the ambiguities of
babaj G I mean I just and in India the
the TAC which I always took with these
people was what can you show me you know
anything because talk is cheap God if I
don't know that who does so a line of
patter is completely non
convincing well it's not uh uh it's not
to be found in those Traditions what I'm
trying to say is that when I put
pressure on the spiritual domain the
only people who could deliver were
shamans with a history of use of
hallucinogenic
plants and um an awareness of this came
to me say as early as
1967 and I began to pursue it uh at
first I pursued uh a pharmacological
basis behind uh Tibetan Shamanism the
pre- Buddhist Shamanism of Tibet is
called puno and I went there thinking
that their art could not possibly be
what it is unless they had access to
hallucinogenic plants and were using
them well I was you know 22 I didn't
know anything I didn't speak these
languages I had no notion of the task
that I was setting up for myself but uh
later I went to the Amazon
basin and there there is extant and
thriving a rich shamanic tradition of
hallucinogenic plant use and they can
just convey you
into uh astonishing dimensions and it's
those astonishing
Dimensions that will form
inevitably the focus of what we do this
month
because it we need to run it as a
headline it goes something like this uh
scientists discover nearby hyper object
in in alternative
Continuum it's that sort of thing it's
that by pushing the Psychedelic
experience we can satisfy and by let me
Define pushing there I mean putting a
great deal of research pressure on uh
the the
tryptamines by pushing the
hallucinogenic psychedelic experience I
think we could fairly quickly satisfy
ourselves if the legal climate were
different that the Freudian model won't
do the yungan model won't do and that in
fact all psychological models will fail
and that what we're dealing with is
something quite of another order and I
am not one to reach for you know the
metaphors of spirit with the connotation
of moral appropri and all that
but there is a a
dimension which is accessible to each
and every one of us this is the primary
thing about it it's
