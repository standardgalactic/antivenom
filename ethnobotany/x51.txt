I love
of diversity to the point of weirdness I
mean I seem there's more to than that
for you because you know being tuned
into ideas and turned on by ideas is one
thing but you can keep that just to
yourself the sharing of it is something
else that's what I'm get you do that
well one thing is I'm really fascin I I
think of myself as a pretty Savvy
person and not uh easily led into false
dogma and yet this is such a strange
idea and so it's basically a plea for
help I am it's it's it's not a cult it's
not that I want you to join me in
believing in this it's that this is so
outlandish that join me as a scientist
would join a research team and let's cut
it to pie pieces and show that it was
simply a misunderstanding of information
Theory coupled with bad mathematics
spliced onto weak ontology or something
like that you know um because this IDE I
I I could under I could live with the
time wave If I Only Had to read about it
in Time Magazine and that it was being
developed by Negron and
progin the thing that sets up the
cognitive dissonance for me is that I
from the point of view of most people
thought it up and I am so aware of my
limitations that to me that's the
strongest argument there is that it's
Maly you know uh and yet that's not a
fair argument against an idea in
rhetoric that's called the ad homonim
argument the argument to the man that's
when you get up and say well we
shouldn't follow Jesse Helms because
he's short and ugly you know that's not
allowed that's below the belt
move uh so and then I read books like
Thomas Kern's the structure of
scientific revolutions and it says you
know this is how it happens some guy
marginal not at the center of the
field uh and somewhat at Loose Ends but
you usually with a broad
education gets it you know I mean it
happened to Einstein he was a
telegrapher it happened to Alfred
Russell Wallace he was a surveyor who
couldn't make a living and so he went to
Indonesia to collect butterflies for the
British
Museum and we could multiply uh these
examples at infinitum so uh but I have
spent a lot of time educating myself
self about what it would mean if this
were true in other words how big a
revolution is it and it's an
enormous Revolution the implications are
staggering for example if it's true that
time is a fluctuating variable as this
so strongly argues then science has
practiced for the past 500 years is out
the window because that kind of Science
is based on the concept of
experiment and experement has built into
it the concept of what's called a
restoration of initial conditions that
means you can go back to the start and
run the experiment again this is saying
as heraclitus said you never step into
the same river twice and consequently
the idea of of repetitive experiment is
shown to be intellectually bankrupt you
could almost say pardon
me have recognized that well some have
and some haven't uh the idea that you
would specify in a physics experiment
that it should be done only when the
moon is in Scorpio to obtain the correct
results would get you experiments are
are primarily utonium in orientation are
they not I mean well give me an example
of a time dependent physical
experiment recognized by
science I mean you know dropping a ball
out of the tower a pie it doesn't matter
what time you do it precisely that's my
point that's my point that that we could
almost say of science that it is the
study of those phenomena so crude that
the time in which they occur does not
affect them and so falling balls uh you
know gas diffusion simple things it
doesn't matter where in time they occur
but things like the building of an
Empire the waging of a war the evolution
