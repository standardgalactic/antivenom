be expected to forge a
solution so what I've tried to say on
this issue uh and some of you who saw
this month's Mother Jones may have
noticed that they put me in there more
picture than text which tells you
something about an age of symbol
uh but what I've tried to say is that we
need to Define drugs
operationally we need to say what it is
we don't like and then we need to find
out what it is that does what we don't
like okay what is it we don't like I
submit to you that what we don't like
about drugs is
unexamined
obsessive and habitual
Behavior unexamined obsessive habitual
Behavior meaning you know somebody's
into something and by God if you get in
their way when they're on their way to
it you're in trouble they have they do
not question their
Obsession they indulge their Obsession
and they will tolerate No discussion of
it so unexamined habitual obsessive
behavior is extremely objectionable to
all of us I think I mean we we call
anything that we don't like we call it
uh robot likee automaton unthinking
zombie so forth and so on well um
imagine if uh our partners in the new
Global materialism the Japanese had
introduced into this country at the end
of World War II a
drug which within a few years made such
deep inroads into the American
population that people were spending an
average of five hours a day loaded on
this
drug what would we think we would think
that it was a crime against a culture on
the scale of uh
aitz but as a matter of fact we did this
to
ourselves television introduced at the
close of World War two has become a a
form of electronic heroin and it isn't
even your trip they don't even let you
go on your own trip you get a trip
designed on Madison Avenue to sell you
know this year's model of uh the crap
mobile or whatever else is being pushed
so
unquestioningly and even as I speak I'm
sure there are people in this audience
who are revolted at my lack of
patriotism and love for an American
institution of such nobility and depth
as TV well you know where I pulled back
from TV really pulled back from it it
was when I made a mild knock on TV and
someone in the audience said well you
can say anything you want about
television but you must admit that it's
given our children a wonderful education
concerning nature
anyway pursuing the theme of
operationally defining um drugs to give
us a little more linguistic
scope uh
psychedelics in contrast to uh
television and heroin uh
dissolve habitual patterns of
activity and promote
examination
of
motives and allow a
restructuring of uh Habit before LSD was
made
illegal back in the
60s uh very respectable psychologists
such as uh Humphrey Osman and uh um
Hofer were C obtaining 40% cure rate of
chonic
alcoholism with one high do
exposure well now understand this
doesn't mean that LSD is a cure for
alcoholism I mean if you think that you
don't know anything about how drugs work
that 40% cure on one high dose exposure
to LSD of alcoholism means that this
person took this psychedelic it
dissolved their boundaries it dissolved
their defenses they came face to face
with the fact that they were killing
themselves and when they came down they
reached into their bowels and found
enough intestinal fortitude to chop it
off well this is real this is the dream
