years in the future Plank's constant is
filling the uh the physics journals and
uh uh you know in uh in art the the uh
po of physics is happening and there's
this uh in in Italy futurism is
beginning the first
futurist tracks are being published well
then uh the first World
War uh quantum physics all of these
things it be it gets weirder it begins
to get weirder it becomes more than
simply an object of optimism it becomes
hideously complex and novel and strange
and bizarre and it reaches an apex in
1933 and I don't have to tell
you so then across the bottom of this
thing uh World War II is fought and
World War II was like a rehearse for the
apocalypse I mean Wars now are not
particularly about anything that was a
war which was about something and it was
utterly surreal for the people who
experienced it to live through I mean it
was about Eugenics it was about rocket
bombs it was about the power of radio to
move millions of people it was about
propaganda it was all kinds of things
and of course it
ended with kicking open the nuclear
doorway uh anybody who doesn't think
world War II was a surreal Extravaganza
I recommend Thomas pinch's novel gravity
rainbow gravity's rainbow which is an
incredible thing to read an incredible
work of literature and
uh you'll never see life again the same
way okay so then once that's all over
and it reaches its apex in the
destruction of the Axis powers and the
use of the at bomb on Japan and so forth
everybody has but one
thought let's knock this off let's have
some kids crack a beer have a barbecue
they even called it the return to
normaly and there was all this uh
uniform Conformity
culture uh Norman Rockwell American
white culture all uh racial sexual
intellectual and social aberant
phenomena was incredibly repressed and
there were some spills along the way the
JFK assassination so forth and so
on and then it approaches the the
cusp the cemetery break and if you have
an incredible memory you may remember
that a few minutes ago I said Homer sang
his song here one cycle back one fractal
scale up so uh the analogy is uh or or
the analogy to Homer singing his song
and to the fall of myia and all of that
or I'm sorry the fall of uh monan
culture to myia is uh the
1960s the the Freak the freak Revolution
the Vietnam War the age of LSD the
landing on the moon at this scale cannot
be discerned from the top of that thing
that all comes together right there 1968
69 that's where the cultural symmetry
break occurs and then a dis the final
descent into novelty at that scale
begins and I submit to you that's a
pretty good rendition of the myth of the
culture that the media reinforces and
that many of us carry I mean we do
believe that was the turning point that
that once rock and roll
LSD sexual permissiveness and all this
stuff was Unleashed we've then just been
refining and experimenting with those
themes uh ever since uh the the
70s were a descent into
novelty the 8S these were fairly steady
descents into novelty but they didn't
surpass The Madness of the middle 40s
until
uh well the early 80s I guess it's not
at scale here but uh and then you know
with the Reagan Era we enter into a kind
of different kind of time this bizarre
oscillation business where uh it it
there are surges of habit and then
collapses into novelty and then
reassertions of Orthodoxy and then
collapses into novelty and this is what
we're experiencing uh now here I'll go
in on this but faster than we've seen in
previously like oscillations happen over
five or 10
years or oscillations over months yeah
um there's now 89 years on the screen
