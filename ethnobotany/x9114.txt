psychedelics have to say about that well
I I believe that
psychedelics show us something which
um capitalist consumer fetish oriented
Society doesn't want us to know what
psychedelics show us is the incredible
richness of our
minds that that you little you can
produce more art in a 20 minute burst of
hallucinatory
intoxication than the Western mind has
produced in the last 500
years our socially created space is
incredibly
impoverished you know we have Picasso's
contribution and Pollock's contribution
and everybody's contribution but it all
together is as nothing compared to the
richness that resides in each one of us
a half inch behind your
eyebrows we are told you know oh well if
you want Beauty you have to own a Lexus
or uh you know if you want a sense of
satisfaction then you need a triple our
garage on and on this this is
absolutely uh not true these are
substitute addictions that will never
satisfy for the genuine article and the
genuine article is a connection into the
guyan Mind well I don't believe or
expect for a moment that ever again
naked tattooed and joyous we will herd
our cattle across the grasslands of
Africa I mean there are 6 million of us
that chance has been
blown uh but but what what can we do to
make to ameliorate our situation well I
have always been an optimist I'm more
optimistic right now than I have been
for a long time because sometimes when
you're an optimist you're an optimist
simply on principle you believe it's
going to turn out all right but you
don't see how it possibly
could I'm beginning to see how it
possibly could turn out all right and
uh my notion is first of all I I follow
in my thinking about Shamanism and I
follow the great historian of religion
mercad who got it almost all right
except that he never embraced
psychedelics he thought they were
decadent but that was just his French
European education and he came too early
but anyway eliad wrote a book called
Shamanism and then he subtitled it the
archaic techniques of ecstasy now he
wrote the book in French in French
technique has a connotation that it
doesn't have in English it means both a
way to do things and it means
technology later the French sociologist
Jac Gul wrote a book called
propaganda and the little Banner under
which his book flew which is printed
right on the frest piece is he says
there are no political
Solutions only technological ones the
rest is propaganda and then he spends
200 Pages explaining what he means by
political Solutions technological
solutions and propaganda by ul's
understanding I agree I think ideology
is toxic all ideology it's not that
there are good ones and bad ones all
ideology is toxic because ideology is a
kind of insult to the gift of human free
thinking I mean if you adopt some
ideology leninism Mormonism it doesn't
matter matter then you have all the
answers you just go and look in the
catechism well I don't know why they
issued you a brain they could have just
given you the
catechism
uh
technology as the
Counterpoint to uh
ideology is a very different animal now
right now we're going through a
technophobic phase because people think
technology means exploding nuclear power
plants and uh you know IR radiated food
and
TV but all technology really means in
the mlan sense is the extensions of man
the extensions of
man and so language is a technology
Shamanism is a technology
psilocybin is a technology and certainly
