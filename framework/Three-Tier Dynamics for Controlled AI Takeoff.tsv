0	6140	Welcome to the Deep Dive. Today we're exploring a theory that, well, it aims to explain just
6140	10080	about everything. Yeah, it's pretty ambitious stuff. From the universe's basic structure,
10720	16940	how your brain processes information, even where AI might be heading. Sounds a bit like
16940	21320	science fiction, doesn't it? It does, but it's a serious proposal. It comes from a research group,
21560	28060	Flixian, and they call it the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum, RSVP for short. RSVP theory. Okay.
28060	32200	And what's really fascinating, I think, is how they weave together ideas from
32200	40000	physics, theoretical physics, neuroscience, and AI research. It's all meant to be one coherent
40000	43440	framework. And where are we getting this information? You mentioned Flixian. Yeah,
43540	47960	exactly. We've got a whole set of their recent papers and even some pretty interesting informal
47960	52860	notes they've put out, all very current, July 2025. Okay. So our mission today is to really get into
52860	58460	this ambitious, maybe even audacious theory. We'll look at the core ideas, how it wants to
58460	64720	redefine things like consciousness, the cosmos, and why they think it offers a better path for AI.
65160	69540	You know, more biologically plausible, maybe more ethically sound. That's the claim.
69940	72500	All right. Prepare for some serious mind bending, I think. Decorate.
72580	75420	So let's start at the heart of it. RSVP theory. Yeah.
75560	78400	You said it's built on, what, three fundamental fields? Yeah.
78400	84080	Like building blocks? Exactly. Three core components. Think of them as the basis for
84080	87300	this new conceptual reality they're proposing. Okay. What are they?
87480	94300	Well, RSVP models pretty much any system, physical, cognitive, even narrative structures,
94480	98180	like stories through how these three fields interact. And this happens over, you know,
98400	100640	standard four-dimensional space time. Right.
100840	106420	So first you've got the scalar field. The Greek letter phi, oh way, this is like the what?
106420	110940	Right. Semantic density, energy concentration, maybe neural activation strength. It's the
110940	113120	substance, the meaning in a given spot. But what?
113360	119860	Second, the vector field, little v. This captures flow, information flow, attention direction,
120600	126560	entropy gradients even. It's the how or where to. It directs movement, influence.
126840	128180	The directionality. Makes sense.
128180	133020	And finally, there's the entropy field. This quantifies the ambiguity, the disorder,
133220	138280	the uncertainty. You know, how much chaos or how much order is there right here, right now?
138540	139480	Chaos versus order.
139720	146260	And a really key idea in RSVP is that the system is always, always trying to minimize this entropy.
146660	150240	It wants to move towards more coherent, more structured states.
150400	154400	Okay. So those are the three pieces. What does it mean for how they actually work together?
154580	155220	How do they interact?
155220	158840	Yeah. They're not just sitting there separately. They're dynamically coupled. That means they
158840	163580	constantly influence each other through things like diffusion, you know, spreading out,
163800	169080	advection being carried along by the flow, and feedback loops, lots of feedback loops. And the
169080	176140	evolution, how these fields change over time, it's governed by equations. Coupled partial differential
176140	181700	equations, actually. It's a bit like how physics describes fluids moving or particles interacting.
181700	183320	So there's real math behind it.
183360	188340	Oh, yeah. Definitely. And the goal is always that drive towards lower entropy. That's what allows
188340	194200	order, structure, meaning to emerge from what might look like just random noise at first.
194320	199120	Okay. Interesting. Immersions from reducing entropy. Let's try and make this more concrete.
199540	201880	Our brains. How does this apply to neuroscience?
202300	208160	Right. So the brain. Neuroscience has puzzled over cortical columns for a long time.
208160	209560	Those vertical clusters of neurons.
209720	214380	Right. Exactly. You can see them anatomically. But figuring out their consistent function has
214380	218620	been tricky, especially because they vary quite a bit, you know, between species, even between
218620	221500	individuals. Horton and Adams pointed this out back in 2005.
221800	224560	So they're not identical units doing the same job everywhere.
224800	229420	Doesn't seem like it. And that raises the question, if they aren't fixed functional units,
229580	230260	what are they?
230260	232440	Okay. And RSVP has an answer.
232880	240880	It offers a reinterpretation. RSVP sees columns not as rigid structures, but as, get this,
241040	242720	emergent coherence tiles.
242980	245280	Emergent coherence tiles. Okay. Unpack that.
245440	250200	Think of them like dynamic patterns. They just sort of arise, self-organize from the interplay
250200	255840	of those three fields, die, V, and S. But they're shaped by specific constraints.
256160	257480	Like what's coming in from our senses.
257480	263100	Exactly. Sensory inputs or even the brain's energy budget. The scalar field, it forms these
263100	268180	low entropy attractor spots where the entropy S gets minimized, where information gets really
268180	271720	focused and ordered. And that's what forms these tiles, these apparent columns.
271820	277020	Ah, so their variability makes sense then. They're context-dependent solutions, not fixed hardware.
277200	281080	Precisely. It depends on the conditions, not some rigid genetic blueprint.
281300	283480	That's a really different way of looking at brain structure.
283480	287880	It is. And it connects nicely with another idea called geometric Bayesianism with sparse
287880	289500	heuristics, or GBSH.
289660	290220	GBSH.
290240	294880	Which basically argues that the brain's amazing efficiency, its sparsity, comes from metabolic
294880	296520	constraints. It has to save energy.
296660	298880	Because the brain uses so much power.
299280	304580	A huge amount. And studies, like by pervs and colleagues more recently, show these conserved
304580	312260	ratios column width to cortical thickness across different species. GBSH and RSVP suggest these
312260	317700	ratios aren't genetic dictates, but geometric scaling laws, driven by minimizing energy.
317940	323020	Wow. Okay. And you mentioned something else, amplitwist operators. That sounds very sci-fi.
323300	326840	Yeah, it does sound a bit out there, doesn't it? But it's a really neat mathematical idea
326840	327420	they use.
327520	328040	What do they do?
328460	331540	Well, what's cool is they combine two things. Amplitude scaling.
331760	333160	Like turning the volume up or down?
333300	335440	Kind of, yeah. Like gain control in your senses.
335660	335840	Yeah.
336080	339540	Adjusting sensitivity. And they combine that with phase rotation.
339720	340260	Phase rotation.
340260	342040	And like waves. Or tuning.
342200	345540	Exactly. Like a neuron changing its tuning or its oscillation pattern.
345980	349880	So these operators, they apply a local transformation. They sort of twist and scale
349880	355180	the neural representations. Imagine zooming in or out on a mental map or rotating your
355180	359860	perspective on something. And the idea is that by composing these operations recursively,
360120	364420	layer after layer in the cortex, the brain can perform really complex functions.
365140	367740	Spatial reasoning. Grouping objects together visually.
367740	372900	So the brain's flexibility isn't from fixed modules, but from dynamically tweaking these
372900	373940	geometric transformations.
374560	378740	That's the argument. It's a much more fluid picture of how the brain computes and adapts.
379120	384960	Fascinating. Okay, let's pivot from biology to artificial intelligence.
385120	385300	Yeah.
385380	385600	AI.
385940	386140	Right.
386140	390700	The current big thing is transformer architectures, right? Powering models like ChatGPT, Bernie.
391120	394140	They rely heavily on this mechanism called self-attention.
394300	394760	They do.
395120	399300	But RSVP theory or affliction seems quite critical of that approach.
399360	400880	What's their issue with self-attention?
401000	404800	Yeah. They have a paper called Attention Considered Harmful. Strong title.
404980	405620	Oh, okay.
405620	411280	Their argument is basically that while transformers work well on current hardware, like GPUs, that
411280	417240	dense self-attention mechanism, it's fundamentally not how biology does it. They argue it's more
417240	422800	like a graph neural network over a fully connected graph, or maybe a shallow recurrent network with a fixed
422800	429140	look ahead. And this, they say, violates something crucial. The natural sparsity principle, NSP.
429560	434440	Natural sparsity principle. You mentioned sparsity with the brain's energy use. Tell us more
434440	440040	about this principle. So, the NSP basically states that biological cognition has to be sparse.
440240	442160	There are critical constraints forcing it.
442220	443160	Like the energy cost.
443520	449440	Exactly. That's number one. Metabolic cost. Your brain burns something like 10 to the 14 ATP molecules
449440	454720	per second. It's incredibly expensive. It absolutely cannot afford dense all-to-all computations
454720	459440	like transformers often do. Sparse activation is key to saving energy.
459740	462220	So, dense attention is just too wasteful biologically?
462220	466500	Way too wasteful, and creates redundant calculations. Second constraint, environmental
466500	471880	noise. Biology operates in a noisy world. Sparse pathways actually improve the signal-to-noise
471880	473860	ratio, makes the system more robust.
473940	474860	Okay. And third?
475240	479680	Thermodynamic gradients. That drive to minimize entropy we talked about, that naturally favors
479680	482980	sparse ordered representations over dense, potentially chaotic ones.
483360	488460	So, transformers are powerful, maybe computationally, but they're not thinking like us because they
488460	491940	violate these fundamental biological or even physical constraints.
492100	493620	That's the core critique, yeah.
493760	493900	Yeah.
493900	497940	They're not respecting the sparsity that seems inherent to natural intelligence.
498400	502180	So, what's the RSVP alternative for AI then? If not attention, then what?
502360	508020	They propose a few interconnected ideas. One is relevance activation theory, or RAT.
508420	508740	RAT.
508740	514120	Okay. Here, attention isn't a built-in mechanism. It's an emergent property that arises from
514120	516680	those RSVP fields interacting recursively.
516940	517620	How does that work?
517760	523920	The scalar field, F-wa, encodes the meaning, the semantics. The entropy field, S, helps suppress
523920	530360	noise and guide the system towards sparse solutions. And the vector field, V, directs the flow of
530360	533300	activation, the spotlight, if you will. It emerges from the dynamics.
533580	534940	Interesting. And you mentioned another one.
534940	540440	Yeah. Aspect relegation theory, or RT. This tries to explain how we shift between different
540440	546060	modes of thinking. You know, slow, deliberate, System 2 thinking versus fast, automatic, System
546060	546840	1 processing.
547020	548020	Kahneman's concepts.
548140	554560	Right. Exactly. In RSVP terms, RT describes this shift as the system learning to reduce entropy
554560	561080	gradients and stabilize the vector field pathways for tasks we practice a lot. Things become automatic
561080	563380	because the flow gets streamlined and efficient.
563380	566120	So it's about learning efficient pathways within these fields.
566260	566480	Exactly.
567200	570140	Yeah. Completely different from just adding more layers or parameters.
570400	575420	It's a fundamentally different architectural approach grounded in these field dynamics
575420	576500	and efficiency principles.
576920	583440	And does this different approach tie into the challenge of controlling AI, this idea of a
583440	584960	controlled AI takeoff?
585080	590280	Absolutely. That's a huge part of the motivation, I think. The question is critical. How do we guide
590280	593420	AI that's becoming potentially super intelligent?
593480	594720	Right. How do we keep it aligned?
595200	600400	RSVP contributes to what they frame as a three-tiered framework for a controlled AI takeoff. It's
600400	601160	quite sophisticated.
601500	602600	Three tiers. Okay. What are they?
602720	607400	Tier one is criticality. This is about when an AI system should act or maybe even learn.
607540	611540	The idea is to tune AI systems to operate near the edge of chaos.
611660	614060	The edge of chaos. Like not too rigid, not too random.
614060	619060	Precisely. It's thought to be a state where information processing is optimal. And here's
619060	624840	the really interesting part. They suggest that collective human preferences, maybe even
624840	631280	nonverbal signals like societal mood or protests, could actually modulate these criticality thresholds.
631400	635320	So society could collectively tap the brakes or hit the gas on AI development.
635440	641440	That's the idea. Dynamically adjusting the AI's operating point based on collective sentiment.
641440	644300	Wow. Okay. Tier one is when? What's tier two?
644620	650200	Tier two is predictive coding. This manages how the AI acts. It's inspired by how our brains
650200	654060	work, constantly trying to predict sensory input and minimize prediction errors.
654220	655660	Like the Bayesian brain idea.
655780	659560	Very much so. AI systems would continuously model and predict human preferences.
660180	663860	Crucially, they penalize themselves for being overconfident in their predictions about us.
663980	666160	So they have to be cautious about assuming what we want.
666160	672360	Exactly. And explicit human feedback votes, dialogues, collective decisions could directly
672360	676800	adjust these internal predictions. If the AI's predictions about our preferences are way off,
676880	678500	maybe training gets paused automatically.
678800	679820	Built-in alignment checks.
680120	681500	Okay. And tier three.
681920	688980	Tier three brings an RSVP directly. This is about ensuring what is meaningful. It models the AI's
688980	694820	decisions and outputs, not just as data, but as ripples in this underlying semantic plenum,
694900	695760	this field of meaning.
695920	696080	Okay.
696400	700700	So you'd use RSVP metrics, things like field coherence or nogentropy, which is like the opposite
700700	705900	of entropy, a measure of order to make sure that the AI's growth and actions actually preserve
705900	711680	meaning. That it doesn't just generate technically correct nonsense or pursue goals that are semantically
711680	713880	hollow or harmful from a human perspective.
713880	718900	So it's about embedding purpose and meaning directly into the AI's operational principles
718900	720500	using this field theory.
720640	725480	That's the goal. Ensuring alignment with human purpose, not just optimizing some narrow technical
725480	725960	objective.
726220	731400	That is a deeply integrated approach to AI safety and governance using field theory itself.
731620	733740	It's definitely thinking outside the usual boxes.
733900	738840	Okay. Let's zoom out again. Way out. From brains and AI to the whole cosmos.
739120	739860	The biggest picture.
739860	744180	We usually think of time as this fundamental thing, right? An external river flowing forward.
744540	745980	Mm-hmm. The standard view.
746540	751100	But there are physicists like Julian Barber who've questioned that. He proposed the universe's
751100	756420	history isn't really an evolution in time, but maybe like a path through a static landscape
756420	757740	of all possible nows.
757740	757880	Yeah.
758880	759780	Configuration space.
759880	762480	Barber's timeless physics. Yeah. As a radical idea.
762580	766380	And RSVP seems to take that idea and run with it. Give it an engine.
766380	770940	Exactly. RSVP, especially when they combine it with another concept they call Tartan.
771080	771860	Tartan. What's that?
772060	775940	Trajectory aware recursive tiling with annotated noise. Quite a mouthful.
776300	776540	Okay.
776660	782880	But basically, Tartan helps RSVP operationalize Barber's idea. In RSVP, remember, the universe's
782880	786240	state at any moment is just the configuration of those VNS fields.
786240	786520	Right.
786820	791640	So time isn't some external clock ticking away. It's generated from within the system.
791800	791960	Right.
792140	796940	It emerges from the interactions of the fields and this process of entropic structuring,
797020	798240	of things becoming more ordered.
798400	801860	So the flow of time we feel, that's just an emergent property.
802020	802120	Yeah.
802160	803740	A consequence of these fields changing.
803740	809380	That's precisely the idea. And Tartan helps visualize this by recursively partitioning
809380	814820	the universe into these coherence tiles we talked about the brain. Each tile has its own local
814820	817820	field state, its own scale, its own entropy level.
817940	819240	Like little pockets of reality?
819680	824840	Sort of. Each one acts like a mini time capsule. Its internal structure implies a past state
824840	830200	and suggests a future trajectory. So time becomes localized and scale dependent. Each tile
830200	835320	essentially has its own internal clock ticking at its own rate based on its history and its current
835320	836280	entropic activity.
836440	838000	Wow. So no universal now.
838120	843340	Not in the absolute sense. This whole framework, they call it the Aletheos canonical form or ACF,
843520	847020	and that constant drive for change, the pressure that makes things happen,
847160	850240	comes from something they call universal origins theory, UET.
850620	857440	Okay. ACF powered by UET, generating localized time from field dynamics. That is radically different
857440	858680	from standard cosmology.
858900	859620	It really is.
859620	864920	Does it offer a different story for how, say, galaxies formed, how we got the large-scale
864920	866500	structure we see in the universe?
866700	871920	It does. It leads to an alternative cosmological model they call expirotic cosmology.
872460	872980	Expirotic.
873100	873220	Yeah.
873300	873980	Non-inflationary.
874100	876760	Exactly. It's a non-inflationary, non-singular model.
876880	882260	It doesn't rely on that super rapid expansion phase, inflation, right after the Big Bang.
882540	886640	And it doesn't need a contracting bounce phase like some other alternative models.
886640	889140	So how does structure emerge in expirosis?
889700	894000	The idea is that cosmic structure arises over incredibly long timescales.
894800	900200	Through the gradual reintegration of information that was sort of decohered or spread out very
900200	905060	early on. And this information, they argue, is encoded in the cosmic microwave background,
905340	906040	the CMB.
906040	910360	The CMB, the afterglow of the Big Bang. How can that be forming structures now? That
910360	912320	seems counterintuitive.
912460	917100	It does, right. But expirosis reinterprets the CMB. It's not just a passive relic. It's a
917100	921980	semantic horizon, an informational boundary holding the patterns from the early universe.
921980	923320	So the information wasn't lost?
923480	929420	Not truly lost, just decohered, latent within the RSVP fields. And then over these absolutely
929420	932320	vast timescales, Poincaré recurrence timescales.
932360	933040	How vast are we talking?
933700	940660	Astronomically vast, like 10 to the power of 50 years. Numbers that make the current age of the
940660	941900	universe seem like an instant.
942040	944060	Okay. Truly mind-boggling timescales.
944260	948540	On those scales, the RSVP fields dynamically recouple this lost information.
948540	955180	They smooth out the entropy gradients, restore coherence. And this process, the slow restructuring
955180	960360	based on the CMB blueprint, is what generates the large-scale homogeneity, the flatness,
960480	962580	the observed fluctuations in the universe.
962860	965760	All without needing a Big Bang singularity or inflation.
966100	970800	That's the claim. It bypasses the need for that initial singularity and the specific physics
970800	977100	of inflation. The CMB isn't just an afterglow. It's the seed crystal. And the RSVP dynamics
977100	979700	slowly grow the universe from it over eons.
980000	983840	That's a profound alternative. Does it make any predictions we could actually test? I mean,
984100	986300	those timescales are impossible to observe directly.
986440	990120	Right. That's the crucial question for any theory like this. And yes,
990240	994260	exploratory cosmology does make some specific, potentially testable predictions that differ
994260	995260	from standard inflation.
995380	995740	Such as...
995740	1002020	It predicts suppressed tensor modes. Basically, very few primordial gravitational waves.
1002520	1008420	The ratio should be less than 0.01, much lower than many inflationary models predict.
1008420	1012320	Okay. That's something current and future experiments are looking for. What else?
1012860	1018300	It suggests there might be residual coherence in the CMB itself, subtle correlations or patterns
1018300	1023540	that shouldn't be there in the standard picture. This could potentially explain some of those large-scale
1023540	1028140	anomalies people have occasionally reported in the CMB data, like the axis of evil.
1028380	1031120	Hmm. Interesting. Anomalies looking for an explanation.
1031380	1035240	And finally, it predicts specific entropy flow signatures in the cosmos.
1035880	1039400	These might show up as subtle anisotropies in dark energy,
1039640	1044040	or maybe unusual correlations in the distribution of galaxies on very large scales.
1044440	1046720	So there are potential observational handles,
1047040	1050060	even if the core process takes unimaginable time?
1050060	1054400	Exactly. It's not purely philosophical speculation. There are empirical consequences.
1054900	1061740	Okay. So bringing this all together, we've gone from brain columns to AI safety to the origin of
1061740	1067360	cosmic structure and the nature of time itself. RSVP theory is trying to connect all of this.
1067840	1069600	What's the big unifying theme here?
1069600	1074500	I think the core unifying theme is this idea that information processing, whether it's in physics,
1074780	1080120	cognition, or AI, fundamentally involves these geometric structure-preserving transformations
1080120	1081880	that minimize entropy.
1082120	1084900	Like those AmpliWIST operators being a universal tool.
1085060	1089180	Exactly. They see that as potentially a fundamental mechanism for perception, representation,
1089600	1094060	inference, operating across all these different domains. It's all about fields interacting,
1094460	1096720	transforming information, and seeking coherence.
1096720	1100340	And where does something like consciousness fit into this grand picture?
1100560	1105400	Well, within this framework, consciousness isn't some spooky extra ingredient. It might emerge
1105400	1110680	naturally as a specific kind of process within these fields, perhaps a recursive entropy-modulated
1110680	1115880	traversal of the semantic field, a lawful way the system navigates and integrates information
1115880	1118040	across different interpretive landscapes.
1118260	1124480	The universe has a giant computational process constantly structuring itself and generating meaning,
1124480	1126640	maybe even consciousness.
1126640	1131880	That seems to be the direction it points, yes. A very information-centric, process-oriented view
1131880	1133020	of reality.
1133300	1137660	And Flixion, in their notes, they seem to push this even further into some really
1137660	1141060	out there, almost artistic or metaphorical territory.
1141560	1147280	I saw things like ancient lunar carvings as a cosmic API for divine computation.
1147800	1148440	What is that about?
1148440	1152680	Huh. Yeah. That's where they really explore the boundaries, maybe playfully, maybe
1152680	1157520	speculatively. It's about taking the core principles, geometric structure, information
1157520	1162580	processing, entropy minimization, and asking, where else could these apply, even in the most
1162580	1164180	extreme or abstract ways?
1164280	1165740	So lunar carvings as an API.
1166140	1166380	Right.
1166460	1171240	Is that suggesting ancient structures could literally be interfaces for some universal computation?
1171580	1175300	It's a provocative thought experiment, right? Could highly ordered, ancient patterns
1175300	1180720	literally function as interfaces. It embodies that form follows function idea at a cosmic,
1180860	1184460	almost mystical scale. It's pushing the metaphor of computation to its limits.
1184920	1191000	And what about comparing someone like Immanuel Swedenborg, the mystic, to a human LLM whose
1191000	1193900	visions were GPU overloaded hallucinations?
1194440	1198660	Again, it's applying the modern computational metaphor back onto historical phenomena.
1199540	1204200	Framing mystical experience or complex internal states as emergent results of an incredibly
1204200	1209200	complex biological computer processing vast amounts of internal data, perhaps reaching
1209200	1214880	overload or generating novel patterns. It's a way to bridge modern AI concepts with older
1214880	1216060	understandings of the mind.
1216360	1220540	So these more poetic phrases, machines that dream in reverse, paper cities that learn to
1220540	1225460	feel, they're not literal claims, but ways to express the theory's potential reach. That
1225460	1229180	meaning and structure can emerge anywhere the right field dynamics exist.
1229480	1233520	I think that's exactly it. They're metaphors suggesting that the core phenomena we associate with
1233520	1238620	life in mind, memory, learning, maybe even feeling might not be exclusively biological. They could
1238620	1243380	be inherent properties of any sufficiently complex system that organizes itself by minimizing entropy
1243380	1244300	within these fields.
1244300	1250200	So building Skynet with a theology degree or needing a firewall for your soul, it's about the deep
1250200	1254620	intertwining of computation, meaning, and maybe even ethics or purpose.
1254620	1260720	Precisely. It suggests the fundamental principles might be universal. That the logic of computation,
1260720	1266320	the drive for meaning, and the need for ethical grounding could all be deeply connected, manifesting in
1266320	1273460	ways that seem both familiar, like AI, and profoundly strange, like, well, like cosmic APIs or soulful
1273460	1278620	firewalls. It pushes us to think about computation and meaning in the broadest possible terms.
1278620	1285420	Wow. Okay. This has been quite the journey. We've really unpacked a theory, RSVP, that asks us to
1285420	1287180	rethink, well, almost everything.
1287260	1288880	It definitely casts a wide net.
1289240	1294340	From the nature of time, how our brains build reality, to the future of AI and its governance,
1294860	1300060	the relativistic scalar vector plenum is, yeah, a truly bold attempt to find a unified language,
1300360	1302840	a mathematical language for emergence across all scales.
1303040	1307520	It really challenges us, doesn't it, to look beyond fixed structures, static objects, and see the
1307520	1311620	universe, see ourselves as these dynamic, self-organizing fields, always interacting,
1311820	1313760	always striving for coherence and meaning.
1313760	1317180	A physics-grounded paradigm for intelligence itself, perhaps.
1317580	1323320	That seems to be the ultimate aim. Integrating geometry, thermodynamics, recursion, information,
1323920	1325040	all into one picture.
1325300	1330860	And it leaves us with this final thought, maybe. If understanding itself emerges from this kind of
1330860	1337100	internal recursion, resolving tensions within the system, like our brain, making sense of conflicting
1337100	1340700	inputs, then maybe something like Gödel's incompleteness theorem.
1341440	1343160	Maybe it's not an ultimate barrier.
1343240	1347080	Perhaps not a hard stop, yeah. Maybe it's more like a feature of the landscape.
1347340	1352560	Right. Just a navigable topological feature in the vast field of knowledge, as maybe affliction
1352560	1355700	might put it. Something that you work with, not something that stops you.
1355700	1361760	What single thing, after all this, really stands out to you? What connection or idea seems most provocative?
1361760	1361940	Do.
1362980	1363260	Yeah.
1363260	1363840	Do.
