Emergent Structures and Control in Neural and Cosmic Systems:
A Uniﬁed Field-Theoretic Approach via RSVP and TARTAN
Flyxion
July 13, 2025
Abstract
This paper presents a uniﬁed ﬁeld-theoretic framework for understanding emergent structures
and control mechanisms in neural, cosmic, and artiﬁcial intelligence systems through the Relativistic
Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) and its recursive extension, Trajectory-Aware Recursive Tiling with
Annotated Noise (TARTAN). Building on established research in cortical organization, parameter-
efﬁcient deep learning, and modern control theory for complex systems, we propose that emergent
structures arise from coupled scalar (Φ), vector (⃗v), and entropy (S) ﬁeld dynamics. In cosmol-
ogy, this manifests as Expyrotic reintegration of cosmic microwave background (CMB) information
over Poincaré recurrence timescales. In neuroscience, cortical columns are reinterpreted as dynamic
amplitwist operators enabling universal function approximation. In artiﬁcial intelligence, control-
theoretic models address alignment challenges through sparse, structure-aware interventions. Our
framework integrates thermodynamic principles with information geometry, offering a mathemati-
cally rigorous foundation for emergent intelligence across scales. Computational validation demon-
strates convergence properties and empirical testability through CMB analysis, neural recordings,
and AI behavior monitoring.
Keywords: emergent structures, ﬁeld theory, cortical columns, AI alignment, control theory,

Introduction
1.1
Motivation and Context
The emergence of complex structures represents a fundamental challenge spanning cosmology, neuro-
science, and artiﬁcial intelligence. Despite decades of research, we lack a uniﬁed theoretical framework
explaining how order arises from apparent randomness across these domains. In cosmology, inﬂationary
models [8, 14] explain cosmic homogeneity but require ﬁne-tuned initial conditions. In neuroscience,
cortical columns exhibit clear anatomical organization [16, 11] yet their functional roles remain debated
[10]. In artiﬁcial intelligence, deep neural networks achieve remarkable performance but face critical
challenges in parameter efﬁciency [7] and alignment [18, 1]. Recent advances in control theory for com-
plex systems [6, 15] and network controllability [4] suggest new pathways for understanding emergent
phenomena. Meanwhile, developments in thermodynamic computing [12, 5] and information geometry
[2] provide mathematical tools for bridging physical and computational perspectives.
1.2
Theoretical Framework Overview
This paper introduces the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework, extended by Trajectory-
Aware Recursive Tiling with Annotated Noise (TARTAN), to model emergent structures and control
mechanisms across neural, cosmic, and artiﬁcial systems. RSVP posits that scalar (Φ), vector (⃗v), and
entropy (S) ﬁelds evolve over four-dimensional spacetime (R4), governed by coupled partial differential
equations that incorporate:
• Thermodynamic consistency through entropy-driven relaxation
1

• Information-geometric principles via scalar-vector coupling
• Nonlocal memory effects through temporal convolution kernels
• Sparsity-induced efﬁciency via natural selection of coherent structures
TARTAN extends this foundation by recursively decomposing ﬁelds into coherence tiles, enabling adap-
tive, multi-scale computation with trajectory-aware optimization.
1.3
Synthesis of Existing Research
Our framework synthesizes insights from multiple established research areas:
1. Expyrotic Cosmology: Reframes structure formation as reintegration of decohered CMB infor-
mation over Poincaré timescales, incorporating sparsity-driven reconstruction methods [7].
2. Cortical Organization: Reinterprets cortical columns as amplitwist operators implementing ge-
ometric transformations on neural representations [10, 16].
3. Parameter Efﬁciency: Integrates Optimal Brain Damage [13] and radial basis function prediction
[7] through thermodynamic pruning mechanisms.
4. AI Alignment and Control: Applies graph-based control theory [6] for scalable oversight of
artiﬁcial general intelligence systems.
5. Geometric Bayesianism: Incorporates biological sparsity principles through thermodynamic con-
straints and stochastic resonance.

The RSVP-TARTAN Framework
2.1
Core Field Dynamics
2.1.1
Field Deﬁnitions and Physical Interpretation
The RSVP framework models emergent phenomena through three fundamental ﬁelds:
• Scalar Field Φ(x, t): Represents semantic density, energy concentration, or neural activation
strength.
• Vector Field ⃗v(x, t): Captures information ﬂow, attention direction, or entropy gradients.
• Entropy Field S(x, t): Quantiﬁes interpretive ambiguity, disorder, or uncertainty.
These ﬁelds evolve over four-dimensional spacetime according to coupled evolution equations that pre-
serve thermodynamic consistency while enabling emergent structure formation.
2

2.1.2
Coupling Mechanisms
The ﬁelds interact through multiple coupling mechanisms:
1. Scalar-Entropy Coupling: Φ and S interact through a damping term −γΦS, where high entropy
regions suppress scalar ﬁeld amplitudes, promoting sparsity.
2. Vector-Entropy Coupling: The vector ﬁeld follows entropy gradients ⃗v = −∇S, ensuring infor-
mation ﬂow toward regions of reduced ambiguity.
3. Nonlocal Memory: Scalar evolution incorporates temporal convolution with boundary memories,
enabling reintegration of historical information.
4. Geometric Constraints: Evolution preserves an energy-like quantity E(t) that bounds ﬁeld am-
plitudes and ensures stability.
2.2
Cosmological Applications: Expyrotic Reintegration
2.2.1
CMB as Semantic Horizon
In cosmological contexts, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) serves as a semantic horizon en-
coding latent ﬁeld conﬁgurations. The scalar ﬁeld Φ represents matter density perturbations, while the
vector ﬁeld ⃗v captures peculiar velocity ﬂows. The entropy ﬁeld S quantiﬁes gravitational instability
and clustering ambiguity. The Expyrotic mechanism operates through reintegration of decohered CMB
information over Poincaré recurrence timescales TP ≈101050 years. This process naturally produces:
• Homogeneity: Entropy-driven relaxation smooths density perturbations.
• Flatness: Scalar-vector coupling maintains geometric consistency.
• Scale-invariant perturbations: Memory kernel K(t −t′) generates appropriate power spectra.
• Absence of singularities: Continuous ﬁeld evolution avoids initial condition problems.
2.2.2
Observational Predictions
The Expyrotic RSVP model predicts several testable cosmological signatures:
1. Suppressed tensor modes: Minimal gravitational wave production (r < 0.01).
2. CMB anomalies: Correlations reﬂecting semantic memory effects.
3. Dark energy anisotropy: Entropy-driven departures from ΛCDM.
4. Large-scale structure: Modiﬁed clustering statistics at megaparsec scales.
2.3
Neuroscience Applications: Cortical Columns as Amplitwist Operators
2.3.1
Resolving the Cortical Column Debate
Horton and Adams (2005) questioned the functional signiﬁcance of cortical columns despite their clear
anatomical organization. Our framework resolves this debate by reinterpreting columns as geometric
operators implementing amplitwist transformations on neural representations. An amplitwist operator
A(θ, s) combines rotation by angle θ and scaling by factor s:
(A(θ, s)Φ)(x) = Φ(sR−θx)
This enables:
3

• Flexible scaling: Zoom operations on spatial or semantic maps.
• Rotational invariance: Orientation-independent processing.
• Recursive composition: Universal function approximation through operator products.
• Dynamic coherence: Adaptive partitioning of representational space.
2.3.2
Universal Function Approximation
Recursive composition of amplitwist operators provides universal function approximation capabilities:
F =
N
Y
i=1
A(θi, si)
This mathematical foundation explains how cortical columns with ﬁxed anatomy can implement ﬂexible
cognitive functions through dynamic parameter modulation.
2.3.3
Neural Sparsity and Efﬁciency
The entropy ﬁeld S naturally implements neural sparsity through thermodynamic constraints. High-
entropy regions undergo parameter pruning, while low-entropy regions maintain dense connectivity.
This mechanism aligns with experimental observations of sparse neural coding [17] and metabolic efﬁ-
ciency constraints [3].
2.4
AI Applications: Control Theory and Alignment
2.4.1
Graph-Based Control for AGI Systems
Modern artiﬁcial intelligence systems exhibit complex, emergent behaviors that challenge traditional
control approaches. Recent work by Coraggio et al. (2025) demonstrates how graph-based control
theory can address these challenges through targeted interventions. We model AGI systems as networks
of interacting agents:
dxi(t)
dt
= fi(xi(t)) +
N
X
j=1
Aijh(xi, xj) + ui(t)
where:
• xi(t): state of agent i (neuron, module, or subsystem).
• Aij: adjacency matrix encoding interaction topology.
• ui(t): control input for intervention.
2.4.2
Pinning Control and Scalable Oversight
Pinning control enables system-wide behavior modiﬁcation by controlling only a subset of nodes:
ui(t) = −k(xi(t) −x∗(t))
if i ∈P, else 0
where P represents pinned nodes and x∗(t) is the desired trajectory. This approach addresses the scala-
bility challenge identiﬁed by Sandberg et al. (2025) by requiring control resources that scale sublinearly
with system complexity.
4

2.4.3
RSVP-Based Alignment Strategy
The RSVP framework enhances AI alignment through:
1. Saliency Detection: Entropy ﬁeld S identiﬁes high-impact intervention points.
2. Sparse Control: TARTAN tiling enables localized, efﬁcient interventions.
3. Stability Guarantees: Lyapunov analysis ensures bounded behavior.
4. Interpretability: Scalar ﬁeld Φ provides semantic grounding for AI decisions.
2.5
TARTAN: Recursive Tiling with Trajectory Awareness
2.5.1
Coherence Tile Identiﬁcation
TARTAN extends RSVP by recursively decomposing ﬁelds into coherence tilesregions of low entropy
that exhibit stable, predictable dynamics. The algorithm operates as follows:
1. Entropy Computation: Calculate S(x, t) = |∇Φ|2.
2. Threshold Detection: Identify regions where S > percentile(S, 85).
3. Connected Components: Extract tiles using graph-based clustering.
4. Recursive Simulation: Re-simulate RSVP dynamics within each tile.
2.5.2
Noise Injection and Exploration
Each coherence tile receives injected noise to explore local semantic attractors:
Φtile(x, t) = Φ(x, t) + η(x, t)
where η(x, t) represents structured noise that promotes exploration while maintaining tile coherence.
This mechanism implements a form of stochastic resonance that enhances system adaptability.
2.5.3
Trajectory-Aware Optimization
TARTAN tracks historical trajectories within each tile, enabling predictive optimization:
Φpredicted(x, t + ∆t) =
k
X
i=1
αiϕ(∥x −xi∥)
where ϕ represents radial basis functions and αi are trajectory-dependent coefﬁcients. This approach
achieves parameter efﬁciency comparable to Denil et al. (2013) while maintaining temporal consistency.
2.6
Parameter Efﬁciency and Thermodynamic Pruning
2.6.1
Integration with Optimal Brain Damage
The RSVP framework naturally incorporates pruning mechanisms inspired by Optimal Brain Damage
[13]. Instead of computing expensive second-order derivatives, we use entropy curvature as a saliency
metric:
Saliency(x) = |∇2S(x, t)|
Parameters with low saliency undergo thermodynamic pruning through entropy-driven relaxation, achiev-
ing computational efﬁciency without explicit Hessian computation.
5

2.6.2
RBF-Based Parameter Prediction
Following Denil et al. (2013), we implement parameter prediction through radial basis functions:
Φ(x) =
k
X
i=1
αiϕ(∥x −xi∥)
where anchor points xi are selected based on entropy minima, and coefﬁcients αi are solved via α =
K−1ΦI, Kij = ϕ(∥xi −xj∥). This approach achieves > 95% parameter reduction while maintaining
approximation quality.

2.9
Conclusion
The RSVP and TARTAN framework uniﬁes emergent structures and control in neural, cosmic, and AI
systems, integrating insights from cortical columns, Optimal Brain Damage, parameter prediction, and
control theory. By reframing columns as amplitwist operators, cosmology as entropic reintegration,
pruning as thermodynamic relaxation, and AGI alignment as graph-based control, this framework offers
a thermodynamically consistent paradigm for emergent intelligence.

where:
• DΦ: diffusion coefﬁcient (DΦ > 0 for stability).
• γ: coupling strength (γ > 0 for entropy-driven damping).
• ε: reintegration parameter (ε ≪1 for perturbative treatment).
• K(t −t′) = e−α(t−t′): exponential memory kernel.
3.1.2
Vector Field with Nonlocal Coupling
The vector ﬁeld satisﬁes:
⃗v = −∇S + η

3.1.3
Entropy Field with Advective Transport
The entropy ﬁeld evolves through:
∂S

where J is the system Jacobian and λ denotes eigenvalues.
3.2.3

Adaptive Mesh Reﬁnement
TARTAN tiling enables adaptive mesh reﬁnement based on entropy gradients:
1. Identify high-entropy regions: S > Sthreshold.
2. Reﬁne mesh locally: ∆xﬁne = ∆xcoarse/2n.
3. Interpolate ﬁelds between mesh levels.
4. Ensure conservation across reﬁnement boundaries.
