Virtually all the conversation about large language models, artificial intelligence, is about their technological implications, things like what are they going to do, what's it going to mean for human labor, and those are extremely important, it's going to have profound implications, but what's being less discussed is the scientific and even the philosophical implications.
And I think these are incredibly profound as well because the fact that these models are able to learn and use language based on just learning the patterns amongst words without any access to other kinds of information demonstrates that language isn't what we thought it is, and that changes everything.
