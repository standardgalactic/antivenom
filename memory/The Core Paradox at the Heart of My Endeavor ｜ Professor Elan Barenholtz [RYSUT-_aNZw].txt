so who there's an inherent problem with my ultimate project which is I want to
use language to deconstruct language in other words I recognize that the insight
the core insight fundamentally changes what the nature of meaning and linguistic
meaning is in such a way that I have to essentially abandon it at some level and
yet at the same time I'm trying to use that very tool to force myself into that
position that I need to abandon it I'm using linguistic I'm using language to
extract to expound sort of to get to this core insight theory whatever you want
to call it and so that seems like something a little bit of a of a paradox
or something like that but so be it
