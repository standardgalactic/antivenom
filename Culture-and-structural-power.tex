\title{Culture and Structural Power:\\
Mute Compulsion as a General Theory of Social Reproduction}

% ==================================================
\begin{abstract}
This paper develops a formal theory of social power centered on structural
constraint, survival, and reproduction. Building on the concept of \emph{mute
compulsion}, it argues that capitalist social order persists not through
persuasion, legitimacy, or cultural hegemony, but through the alignment of
survival with participation. Culture is treated not as a primary causal driver
but as an adaptive coordination layer, selectively stabilized by material
viability.

The argument is formalized using constraint fields, entropy functionals, and
event-historical dynamics. Structural power is modeled as the continuous pruning
of admissible futures, while reproduction occurs along low-entropy trajectories
that coincide with ordinary survival behavior. Political change is shown to be a
threshold phenomenon requiring counter-structures capable of temporarily
decoupling survival from compliance.

The paper further introduces extraction fields to model attention-based
platforms, demonstrating how advertising saturation constitutes a stable
equilibrium of asymmetric value transfer that degrades cultural coherence while
remaining structurally profitable. Universality is redefined as structural
invariance across constraint fields, explaining the strategic efficacy of
material demands over identity-fragmented claims.

By integrating materialist social theory with a field-theoretic and
event-historical framework, the paper generalizes class analysis beyond
political economy, offering a unified account of durability, resistance, and
the conditions under which alternative futures become materially viable.

% ==================================================
\section{Introduction}
% ==================================================

This essay develops a structural account of social power centered on the concept
of \emph{mute compulsion}: the idea that systems may secure compliance not by
persuasion, coercion, or legitimacy, but by organizing the conditions of survival
themselves. The immediate object of analysis is capitalist society, but the
argument generalizes beyond political economy to any system whose reproduction
is coupled to agents’ material viability.

Against theories that locate social order primarily in culture, discourse, or
ideology, the approach developed here treats culture as an adaptive medium rather
than a sovereign driver. Social structures persist when the actions required to
reproduce them coincide with the actions required to remain alive within them.

The essay proceeds in four stages. First, it formalizes structural constraint and
distinguishes it from agentic power. Second, it models culture as a filtered
coordination layer. Third, it analyzes time, reproduction, and political change
as threshold phenomena. Finally, it integrates these insights into a general
field-theoretic and event-historical framework.

% ==================================================
\section{Constraint and Structural Power}
% ==================================================

Social power admits of two analytically distinct forms. The first is \emph{agentic
power}: the ability of an actor or institution to issue commands backed by
sanctions. The second is \emph{structural power}: the power exerted by the
configuration of conditions within which action occurs.

\begin{definition}[Structural Constraint]
A \emph{structural constraint} is a condition $c \in \Struct$ such that failure to
comply with $c$ results in loss of material viability.
\end{definition}

In capitalist societies, the central structural constraint is the absence of
independent access to the means of subsistence. Agents lacking such access must
sell their labor in order to secure food, shelter, and reproduction.

Let $\State$ denote the space of admissible agent states and $\Action$ the space
of actions available to an agent.

\begin{definition}[Survival Operator]
Define the survival operator
\[
\Survive : \State \times \Action \to \{0,1\}
\]
such that $\Survive(s,a)=1$ iff action $a$ taken in state $s$ preserves material
viability.
\end{definition}

The defining feature of mute compulsion is that, for most states $s$,
\[
\Survive(s,a)=1 \quad \text{only if} \quad a \in \Action_{\text{market}},
\]
where $\Action_{\text{market}}$ denotes participation in labor-mediated exchange.

No command is required. The constraint is enforced by the environment itself.

% ==================================================
\section{Binary Thresholds and Continuous Pressure}
% ==================================================

Structural constraint operates at two levels simultaneously.

\begin{lemma}[Survival Threshold]
Material viability imposes a binary condition:
\[
\Survive(s,a) \in \{0,1\}.
\]
An agent either survives or does not.
\end{lemma}

However, the \emph{experience} of constraint varies continuously.

\begin{definition}[Compulsion Gradient]
Let $\Energy(s)$ denote the slack or buffer available to an agent in state $s$
(e.g.\ savings, welfare access, labor scarcity). Define the compulsion gradient
\[
\lambda(s) = -\Grad \Energy(s).
\]
\end{definition}

Higher slack corresponds to lower felt compulsion, but does not remove the
underlying threshold. Even when $\lambda(s)$ is small, the survival condition
remains binding.

This dual structure explains how systems can feel permissive while remaining
structurally absolute.

% ==================================================
\section{Reproduction as Low-Maintenance Dynamics}
% ==================================================

Structural power is not self-propelling; it must be reproduced through action.
However, reproduction may be \emph{low-maintenance} if survival-aligned actions
coincide with system reproduction.

\begin{definition}[Reproduction Operator]
Define the reproduction operator
\[
\Reprod : \Hist \to \Hist
\]
mapping histories to extended histories through ordinary survival actions.
\end{definition}

Capitalism is reproduced because:
\[
\Survive(h_t, a_t) = 1 \;\; \Rightarrow \;\; \Reprod(h_{t+1}),
\]
for most admissible histories $h_t$.

Unlike systems requiring constant coercion or ideological reinforcement, this
structure is robust because compliance is endogenous to survival.

% ==================================================
\section{Constraint as Boundary Condition}
% ==================================================

Structural constraint functions not as a force but as a boundary condition on
admissible trajectories.

Let $\Hist$ denote the space of event histories. Define the admissible subset
\[
\Hist_{\text{adm}} = \{ h \in \Hist \mid \forall t,\; \Survive(h_t,a_t)=1 \}.
\]

All large-scale social dynamics occur within $\Hist_{\text{adm}}$. Culture,
politics, and ideology operate by selecting paths within this space, not by
removing its boundaries.

This completes the foundational formalization of mute compulsion as structural
constraint. The next section turns to culture as an adaptive coordination layer
within these constraints.

% ==================================================
\section{Culture as an Adaptive Medium}
% ==================================================

All social action is mediated by meaning. Agents do not merely respond to
constraints; they interpret, anticipate, and coordinate. The error of the
cultural turn is not its attention to meaning, but its elevation of meaning to
primary causal status. Culture does not generate structural persistence; it
adapts to it.

\begin{definition}[Cultural Configuration]
Let $\Culture$ denote the space of cultural configurations, understood as shared
scripts, norms, expectations, and interpretive frames that guide action.
\end{definition}

Cultural configurations do not operate independently of structure. They are
selected and stabilized insofar as they permit survival within existing
constraints.

% ==================================================
\section{Cultural Scripts as Coordination Devices}
% ==================================================

Cultural scripts solve coordination problems under constraint. They reduce
uncertainty about how others will behave and about which actions are viable.

Let $\pi_k(a \mid s)$ denote the probability of action $a$ in state $s$ under
cultural configuration $k \in \Culture$.

\begin{definition}[Viable Culture]
A cultural configuration $k$ is \emph{viable} iff
\[
\mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi_k}[\Survive(s,a)] = 1
\quad \text{for a large measure of states } s.
\]
\end{definition}

Cultural configurations that systematically generate non-viable actions decay
rapidly at scale. They may persist locally or temporarily, but cannot stabilize
as mass phenomena.

This gives culture a selective environment: not all meanings are equally
reproducible.

% ==================================================
\section{Selective Filtering and Structural Anchoring}
% ==================================================

Cultural innovation is constant. New norms, values, and identities emerge
continuously. However, their persistence is governed by a filtering process.

\begin{proposition}[Material Filtering]
Let $k_t$ be a cultural configuration at time $t$. If
\[
\mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi_{k_t}}[\Survive(s,a)] < 1
\]
for a non-negligible set of states $s$, then
\[
\lim_{t \to \infty} \Pr(k_t \text{ persists}) = 0.
\]
\end{proposition}

This does not imply conscious calculation. Filtering occurs through differential
attrition: agents and groups whose practices are incompatible with survival
conditions exit, adapt, or shrink.

Over time, adaptive scripts harden into norms.

\begin{definition}[Internalized Norm]
A cultural script $k$ is \emph{internalized} when its associated actions are
executed without explicit instrumental reasoning.
\end{definition}

Internalization produces the appearance of autonomy. However, anchoring remains.
When the material conditions supporting a norm erode, the norm typically decays,
albeit with lag.

% ==================================================
\section{Culture, Common Sense, and Apparent Autonomy}
% ==================================================

Internalized norms generate what appears as ``common sense.'' These norms feel
moral, natural, or inevitable precisely because they are aligned with survival.

Let $\Entropy(k)$ denote the entropic cost of maintaining cultural configuration
$k$ within structure $\Struct$.

\begin{lemma}[Low-Entropy Norms]
Cultural norms with low $\Entropy(k)$ relative to $\Struct$ are more stable than
those requiring constant reinforcement.
\end{lemma}

Capitalist workplace norms persist not because they are deeply believed, but
because violating them is costly. The system does not require ideological
saturation; it requires only that deviation be expensive.

% ==================================================
\section{When Culture Becomes Causally Operative}
% ==================================================

Culture becomes a primary causal factor only under specific conditions.

\begin{definition}[Coordination Gap]
A coordination gap exists when no individually viable action yields a
collectively viable outcome.
\end{definition}

Collective action problems instantiate coordination gaps. Here, culture can
alter structure.

\begin{proposition}[Cultural Feedback Condition]
Culture becomes a causal driver of structural change iff it enables coordinated
action that alters $\Struct$ itself, such that
\[
\Struct_{t+1} \neq \Struct_t.
\]
\end{proposition}

Unions, parties, and disciplined movements exemplify this condition. Their
cultural forms matter not as symbols, but as mechanisms for synchronizing action
across agents.

Absent this feedback, culture remains adaptive rather than generative.

% ==================================================
\section{Limits of Cultural Causality}
% ==================================================

Cultural frames that do not resolve coordination gaps may circulate indefinitely
without altering constraints. Symbolic critique, expressive identity, and moral
denunciation do not, by themselves, modify $\Hist_{\text{adm}}$.

This explains the persistence of high cultural volatility alongside remarkable
structural stability. Culture churns; structure endures.

The next section turns to time, reproduction, and political strategy, examining
how structural change occurs when adaptive coordination crosses critical
thresholds.

% ==================================================
\section{Time, Reproduction, and Political Change}
% ==================================================

Structural systems persist not merely because they constrain action, but because
they reproduce themselves over time through irreversible sequences of ordinary
activity. Any adequate theory of social change must therefore model time not as a
neutral parameter, but as a constitutive dimension of power.

Let $\Hist = \{h_0, h_1, \dots \}$ denote an event history, where each $h_t$
represents the cumulative state of the system at time $t$.

\begin{definition}[Irreversible Event]
An event $e_t$ is \emph{irreversible} if its effects on $\Hist$ cannot be undone
without additional cost or intervention.
\end{definition}

Most survival-aligned actions—rent payments, work shifts, debt servicing—are
irreversible in this sense. They accumulate history and progressively restrict
future options.

% ==================================================
\section{Reproduction Through Ordinary Action}
% ==================================================

Capitalist reproduction occurs through actions that agents must perform in order
to survive. Let $a_t$ be the action taken at time $t$.

\[
h_{t+1} = h_t \cup \{a_t\}
\]

When $a_t$ satisfies the survival condition, it simultaneously extends the
history that sustains the structure.

\begin{proposition}[Daily Reproduction]
If for most $t$,
\[
\Survive(h_t, a_t) = 1,
\]
then the structure $\Struct$ is reproduced without requiring extraordinary
intervention.
\end{proposition}

This gives capitalist systems a temporal advantage: they renew themselves
continuously, while opposition must organize discontinuously.

% ==================================================
\section{Threshold Dynamics and Nonlinear Change}
% ==================================================

Political change does not occur smoothly. Organizational gains accumulate until
they cross a threshold beyond which qualitatively new outcomes become possible.

Let $O(t)$ denote the organizational capacity of a movement at time $t$, measured
in members, funds, discipline, or institutional presence.

\begin{definition}[Structural Threshold]
A threshold $\theta$ exists such that
\[
O(t) < \theta \;\; \Rightarrow \;\; \Delta \Struct \approx 0,
\]
while
\[
O(t) \ge \theta \;\; \Rightarrow \;\; \Delta \Struct \neq 0.
\]
\end{definition}

Below the threshold, action is expressive. Above it, action becomes structural.

This explains why long periods of apparent stagnation can precede sudden shifts
in power relations.

% ==================================================
\section{Counter-Structures and Temporal Leverage}
% ==================================================

Because reproduction is continuous, resistance must interrupt survival-aligned
action long enough to stabilize alternative trajectories.

\begin{definition}[Counter-Structure]
A counter-structure is an organized system that temporarily supplies survival
conditions independently of $\Struct$.
\end{definition}

Examples include strike funds, mutual aid networks, legal defense, and political
protections. Formally, a counter-structure modifies the survival operator:

\[
\Survive'(s,a) = 1 \quad \text{even when} \quad a \notin \Action_{\text{market}}.
\]

\begin{lemma}[Cost Reduction]
Counter-structures reduce the energetic and entropic cost of resistance, making
noncompliance temporarily viable.
\end{lemma}

Without counter-structures, resistance collapses into individual sacrifice rather
than collective leverage.

% ==================================================
\section{Mediation and the Professional-Managerial Class}
% ==================================================

Large-scale organization requires mediation. Coordination channels, leadership
roles, and interpretive frameworks must be maintained. This introduces a distinct
stratum whose structural position differs from that of wage-dependent workers.

\begin{definition}[Professional-Managerial Class]
The Professional-Managerial Class (PMC) consists of agents hired by capital to
organize, supervise, or manage labor rather than directly perform it.
\end{definition}

The PMC occupies an intermediate position: dependent on wages, yet invested in
autonomy, expertise, and status.

% ==================================================
\section{PMC as Control Surface}
% ==================================================

In movements, the PMC often functions as a control surface, translating material
demands into administrable or culturally legible forms.

\begin{definition}[Control Surface]
A control surface is a mediating layer that maps demands $D$ into actions $A$ via
interpretive or organizational filters.
\end{definition}

Because PMC members possess more discretionary time, cultural capital, and access
to coordination channels, they disproportionately influence this mapping.

\begin{proposition}[Displacement Risk]
If the control surface prioritizes moral legitimacy or symbolic coherence over
material leverage, then
\[
\Delta O(t) < 0 \quad \text{relative to potential}.
\]
\end{proposition}

This displacement weakens threshold accumulation and dissipates structural power.

% ==================================================
\section{Coalition Leadership and Failure Modes}
% ==================================================

Effective coalitions require heterogeneous participation. However, leadership
cannot be neutral.

\begin{lemma}[Leadership Constraint]
A coalition must be led by agents whose structural position grants maximal
leverage over $\Struct$.
\end{lemma}

Wage-dependent workers possess such leverage through their capacity to disrupt
production. The PMC contributes skills and coordination capacity, but failure
occurs when managerial logics override survival-driven priorities.

This completes the analysis of time, reproduction, and mediation. The final
section integrates these dynamics into a generalized field-theoretic and
event-historical framework.

% ==================================================
\section{Advertising Saturation as Structural Degradation}
% ==================================================

Before turning to formal constraint dynamics, it is necessary to confront a
phenomenon often treated as peripheral but which in fact exemplifies the moral
and structural logic under analysis: the saturation of everyday life by
advertising.

Consider the contemporary social media feed, in which approximately every
third post is an advertisement. This is not merely intrusive; it is
structurally corrosive. Advertising of this form bypasses nearly all traditional
methods by which economic activity historically established legitimacy or
value. There is no apprenticeship, no reputation, no local trust, no craft, no
demonstrated competence. Instead, visibility is purchased directly. Whoever is
willing to pay is elevated, regardless of substance, relevance, or merit.

This represents a profound inversion of social signaling. The feed no longer
reflects the interests one has cultivated, the communities one has joined, or
the local networks one inhabits. Years of curating one’s social and intellectual
environment—finding peers in one’s area, sharing practices, building
relationships—are undone by the indiscriminate insertion of gaudy,
incoherent, and frequently fraudulent solicitations every few seconds.

The moral pathology is especially stark under conditions of scarcity. When the
user has no money, advertising does not merely fail to serve them; it actively
harms them. It incessantly reframes success in terms of acquisition that is
materially impossible, producing a constant contrast between lived constraint
and advertised fantasy. This is not neutral persuasion but a systematic
manipulation of aspiration under conditions where aspiration cannot be realized.

Moreover, much of this advertising promotes forms of grueling materialism and
voyeuristic tourism: curated experiences, luxury lifestyles, extractive travel,
and aestheticized consumption that detach desire from any stable form of social
participation or productive agency. The user is invited to look, envy, and
desire—but never to belong or build.

The economic structure underpinning this system reveals its ethical character.
Most advertisers in these ecosystems do not profit. They are small operators,
drop-shippers, spam farms, or speculative entrepreneurs who lack the capacity to
produce genuinely valuable goods or meaningful content, but who are nonetheless
willing to pay for exposure. Their failure is not incidental; it is systemic.

The platform extracts money from those least able to afford it, aggregating
these losses upward into vast rents captured by the already wealthy owners of
the advertising infrastructure. In this sense, the system functions as a
\emph{reverse Robin Hood}: it steals from the poor, the desperate, and the
gullible, and redistributes upward to the ultra-rich, all while presenting
itself as neutral market mediation.

This is not a cultural accident. It is a direct expression of structural
constraint. Advertising thrives precisely because survival under capitalism
forces participation in attention markets regardless of their quality or moral
standing. The result is not merely annoyance, but the active degradation of
social meaning, trust, and orientation.

The advertising-saturated feed thus provides a concrete, everyday illustration
of mute compulsion at work: individuals endure an environment they despise not
because they consent to it, but because exit carries unacceptable social and
material costs. What appears as cultural noise is in fact structural violence
rendered banal.

With this in view, the subsequent formal analysis of constraint, culture, and
reproduction should be read not as abstraction, but as an attempt to explain why
such an environment is not only possible, but profitable—and why moral appeal
alone is powerless to stop it.

% ==================================================
\section{Why Moral Critique Fails Under Structural Constraint}
% ==================================================

The persistence of advertising saturation despite widespread resentment is not a
paradox, nor a failure of moral clarity. It is a predictable outcome of a system
in which harm is profitable precisely because it is structurally embedded.
Moral critique presupposes an addressee capable of choice: an agent who could do
otherwise if properly persuaded. Structural power nullifies this presupposition.

In environments governed by survival-conditioned participation, the relevant
decision variables are not values or intentions but costs, gradients, and
thresholds. Platforms do not optimize for legitimacy, coherence, or social
well-being; they optimize for extraction subject to retention constraints.
Advertising persists because it satisfies these constraints, not because anyone
believes it is good.

This renders moral appeal strategically impotent. Condemnation, exposure, and
normative argument may circulate indefinitely without altering outcomes so long
as they fail to modify the underlying constraint field. Even universal disgust
does not translate into change if exit is costly and coordination is fragmented.
In such cases, outrage becomes another low-energy dissipation channel: expressive
but non-intervening.

The appropriate analytic response is therefore not ethical intensification but
structural re-description. To intervene in a system that reproduces itself
through ordinary survival activity, one must identify the variables that govern
reproduction itself. This requires abandoning agent-centered explanations in
favor of field-level analysis: mapping viability regions, extraction gradients,
entropy flows, and admissible futures.

The formal analysis that follows should thus be read as a shift in explanatory
register. Where moral critique asks whether a practice is justified, structural
analysis asks whether it is stable. Where ethical discourse seeks better reasons,
constraint analysis seeks leverage. Only the latter can explain why practices
that are widely hated nonetheless endure—and what it would take, in concrete
terms, for them to stop.


% ==================================================
\section{Constraint as Field Boundary Condition}
% ==================================================

The dynamics analyzed thus far admit a more general formulation. Structural
constraints function as boundary conditions on an underlying field of possible
social trajectories. Capitalism is not merely a system of rules or institutions,
but a configuration of conditions that defines which paths through social space
are viable.

Let $\Field$ denote a scalar constraint field over state space $\State$.

\begin{definition}[Constraint Field]
The constraint field $\Field : \State \to \mathbb{R}$ assigns to each state $s$
the cost of maintaining material viability.
\end{definition}

Survival corresponds to remaining within a bounded region of this field.

\[
\Survive(s,a) = 1 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \Field(s') \le \Field_{\max},
\]
where $s'$ is the successor state induced by action $a$.

Mute compulsion arises when the gradient of this field strongly penalizes actions
outside a narrow corridor of admissible behavior.

% --------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Extraction Fields and Attention Gradients}
% --------------------------------------------------

Not all constraint fields merely delimit viability. Some actively extract value
from agents by shaping the distribution of attention itself. Contemporary
advertising platforms instantiate such an \emph{extraction field}.

Let $\Attention$ denote a finite attentional budget available to an agent over a
time interval, and let $E$ denote an extraction operator acting on attention.

\begin{definition}[Extraction Field]
An extraction field is a scalar field
\[
\Psi : \State \to \mathbb{R}
\]
whose gradient induces a net transfer of value from agents to the field’s
operators by capturing attention independently of agent interest or benefit.
\end{definition}

Unlike productive fields, which exchange value symmetrically, extraction fields
operate by imposing involuntary exposure. The relevant dynamic is not persuasion
but capture.

Let $a_t$ be an attentional allocation at time $t$. The extraction rate is given
by
\[
\mathcal{X}(s) = \Grad \Psi(s) \cdot a_t,
\]
which measures the rate at which attention is diverted away from agent-chosen
trajectories.

In advertising-saturated environments, this diversion is decoupled from
relevance, quality, or trust. Visibility is allocated not by informational value
but by payment, yielding a monotonic relationship between capital and exposure.

\begin{proposition}[Asymmetric Loss]
For most agents $s$, the expected return on extracted attention satisfies
\[
\mathbb{E}[\text{value gained} \mid \mathcal{X}(s)] < \mathbb{E}[\text{value lost}],
\]
while the aggregate surplus is captured upstream by platform owners.
\end{proposition}

This asymmetry explains why extraction fields persist even when most advertisers
fail. The system does not optimize for mutual benefit, but for maximal aggregate
extraction under survival-conditioned participation.

Crucially, extraction fields interfere with cultural adaptation. They overwrite
locally curated interest structures with incoherent, externally imposed signals,
thereby increasing entropic load while preserving structural profitability.

Advertising saturation is thus not a market imperfection but a stable
equilibrium: a low-maintenance extraction regime nested within the broader
constraint field of capitalism.


% ==================================================
\section{Entropic Reproduction and Stability}
% ==================================================

The reproduction of structure can be understood entropically. Actions aligned
with survival tend to minimize energetic and organizational expenditure.

Let $\Entropy(h)$ denote the entropy associated with maintaining history $h$.

\begin{proposition}[Low-Entropy Reproduction]
Structures persist when
\[
\Entropy(h_{t+1}) - \Entropy(h_t) \approx 0
\]
for survival-aligned actions.
\end{proposition}

Capitalism is stable because its reproduction coincides with low-entropy
behavior: working, paying rent, and complying with institutional routines
requires less energy than sustained deviation.

Resistance, by contrast, is initially high-entropy. It demands coordination,
sacrifice, and sustained deviation from default paths. This explains why
counter-structures are necessary to reduce entropic cost during periods of
conflict.

% ==================================================
\section{Event-Historical Trajectories}
% ==================================================

Social systems evolve through irreversible event sequences. Each action updates
the space of possible futures.

Let $\mathsf{Fut}(h_t)$ denote the set of admissible futures following history
$h_t$.

\begin{definition}[Admissible Future]
A future history $h_{t+1}$ is admissible iff
\[
h_{t+1} \in \Hist_{\text{adm}}.
\]
\end{definition}

Structural power operates by continuously pruning $\mathsf{Fut}(h_t)$, narrowing
the range of viable trajectories. Ordinary survival actions incrementally lock
in paths that reproduce the existing field.

Political intervention, therefore, is not merely oppositional but
path-constructive: it seeks to expand $\mathsf{Fut}(h_t)$ by altering constraint
conditions.

% ==================================================
\section{Universality as Structural Invariance}
% ==================================================

Within this framework, universality acquires a precise meaning. Universal demands
correspond to invariants across the constraint field.

\begin{definition}[Structural Invariant]
A demand $D$ is structurally universal if it targets a feature of $\Field$ shared
across a wide measure of states $s \in \State$.
\end{definition}

Healthcare, housing, and wages are universal because they attach to survival
thresholds rather than contingent identities. They intersect the same boundary
conditions for heterogeneous agents.

Identity-fragmented demands, by contrast, attach to local features of the field
and therefore fail to aggregate pressure at scale.

% ==================================================
\section{Decoupling Survival and the Limits of Compulsion}
% ==================================================

The mute-compulsion thesis admits a clear limit case.

\begin{proposition}[Decoupling Condition]
If survival becomes independent of market participation for a large population,
then the constraint field $\Field$ flattens:
\[
\Grad \Field \approx 0.
\]
\end{proposition}

Under such conditions, structural power weakens dramatically. Order must then be
maintained through ideological saturation or direct coercion, both of which are
costly and unstable.

This provides a falsifiability condition for the framework and a diagnostic for
future political possibilities.

% ==================================================
\section{Conclusion}
% ==================================================

This essay has reconstructed a materialist theory of social power centered on
constraint, survival, and reproduction. Capitalist domination persists not
because it persuades, but because it organizes the conditions under which action
remains viable.

Culture adapts to these conditions, coordinating action within constrained
spaces. The advertising-saturated feed is therefore not incidental but diagnostic: it is the visible trace of an extraction field that monetizes attention precisely where exit is costly, redistributing losses upward while presenting the result as neutral exchange.

Political change occurs when coordination accumulates beyond thresholds
and interrupts reproduction through counter-structures. Mediation introduces
failure modes when symbolic legitimacy displaces material leverage.

Integrated into a field-theoretic and event-historical framework, these dynamics
generalize beyond political economy. Systems endure when compliance coincides
with survival; they destabilize only when alternative trajectories become
materially viable.

Politics, in this view, is not primarily a struggle over meaning. It is a
struggle over which futures can exist.

\appendix
\section{Formal Constraint Fields}
% ==================================================

\subsection{State Space and Actions}

Let $\State$ be a measurable state space and $\Action$ a set of admissible
actions.

Let
\[
T : \State \times \Action \to \State
\]
be the state transition operator.

\subsection{Constraint Field}

Define the constraint field
\[
\Field : \State \to \mathbb{R}
\]
with upper viability bound $\Field_{\max} \in \mathbb{R}$.

\begin{definition}[Viability Region]
The viability region is
\[
\State_{\text{viable}} = \{ s \in \State \mid \Field(s) \le \Field_{\max} \}.
\]
\end{definition}

\subsection{Survival Operator}

Define the survival operator
\[
\Survive(s,a) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } T(s,a) \in \State_{\text{viable}}, \\
0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\]

\subsection{Admissible Actions}

For a given state $s$, define the admissible action set
\[
\Action_{\text{adm}}(s) = \{ a \in \Action \mid \Survive(s,a) = 1 \}.
\]

\subsection{Mute Compulsion Condition}

\begin{definition}[Mute Compulsion]
Mute compulsion holds at $s$ if
\[
|\Action_{\text{adm}}(s)| \ll |\Action|.
\]
\end{definition}

Equivalently, mute compulsion holds when the gradient
\[
\|\Grad \Field(s)\|
\]
is large relative to action-induced displacement in $\State$.

\subsection{Slack Parameter}

Define slack
\[
\Energy(s) = \Field_{\max} - \Field(s).
\]

Then
\[
\Grad \Energy(s) = - \Grad \Field(s).
\]

High slack corresponds to weak felt compulsion without altering admissibility.

\subsection{Boundary Dynamics}

Let $\gamma : [0,T] \to \State$ be a trajectory.

Then $\gamma$ is viable iff
\[
\forall t \in [0,T], \quad \gamma(t) \in \State_{\text{viable}}.
\]

Violation at any $t$ yields trajectory termination.

% ==================================================
\subsection{Structural Robustness}
% ==================================================

\begin{proposition}[Low-Maintenance Structure]
If for almost all $s \in \State_{\text{viable}}$,
\[
\exists a \in \Action_{\text{adm}}(s)
\quad \text{such that} \quad
\Reprod(s,a) = 1,
\]
then the structure is self-reproducing under survival dynamics.
\end{proposition}

% ==================================================
\section{Entropic Reproduction Dynamics}
% ==================================================

\subsection{Event Histories}

Let
\[
\Hist = \{ h_0, h_1, \dots, h_T \}
\]
denote a finite event history, where each $h_t$ is the cumulative system state at
time $t$.

Let $e_t$ denote the event occurring at time $t$ such that
\[
h_{t+1} = h_t \cup \{e_t\}.
\]

\subsection{Entropy Functional}

Define an entropy functional
\[
\Entropy : \Hist \to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}
\]
measuring the organizational, energetic, or coordination cost of maintaining
history $h$.

\subsection{Incremental Entropy}

Define the incremental entropy
\[
\Delta \Entropy_t = \Entropy(h_{t+1}) - \Entropy(h_t).
\]

\begin{definition}[Low-Entropy Action]
An action $a_t$ is low-entropy at $h_t$ if
\[
\Delta \Entropy_t \approx 0.
\]
\end{definition}

\subsection{Reproduction Operator}

Define the reproduction indicator
\[
\Reprod(h_t, a_t) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } h_{t+1} \text{ preserves } \Struct, \\
0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\]

\subsection{Reproductive Stability}

\begin{proposition}[Entropic Stability]
A structure $\Struct$ is entropically stable if for almost all viable histories
$h_t$,
\[
\exists a_t \in \Action_{\text{adm}}(h_t)
\quad \text{such that} \quad
\Delta \Entropy_t \approx 0
\;\; \text{and} \;\;
\Reprod(h_t,a_t)=1.
\]
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Survival-Aligned Actions}

Define the survival-aligned action set
\[
\Action_{\text{surv}}(h_t) =
\{ a \in \Action_{\text{adm}}(h_t) \mid \Survive(h_t,a)=1 \}.
\]

\begin{lemma}[Entropy Minimization]
For most $h_t$,
\[
\arg\min_{a \in \Action_{\text{surv}}(h_t)} \Delta \Entropy_t
\subseteq \Action_{\text{market}}.
\]
\end{lemma}

\subsection{High-Entropy Resistance}

Define resistance actions
\[
\Action_{\text{res}}(h_t) =
\Action_{\text{adm}}(h_t) \setminus \Action_{\text{market}}.
\]

Then typically
\[
\mathbb{E}_{a \in \Action_{\text{res}}}[\Delta \Entropy_t]
\gg
\mathbb{E}_{a \in \Action_{\text{market}}}[\Delta \Entropy_t].
\]

\subsection{Counter-Structures}

Let $C$ denote a counter-structure.

Define the modified entropy
\[
\Entropy_C(h) = \Entropy(h) - \Delta_C(h),
\]
where $\Delta_C(h) \ge 0$ captures entropic support supplied by $C$.

\begin{proposition}[Entropy Reduction]
If
\[
\Delta_C(h) \ge
\mathbb{E}_{a \in \Action_{\text{res}}}[\Delta \Entropy],
\]
then resistance trajectories become entropically viable.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Phase Preference}

Define the preferred phase
\[
\mathcal{P}(h_t) = \arg\min_{a \in \Action_{\text{adm}}(h_t)} \Delta \Entropy_t.
\]

Structural persistence follows when
\[
\mathcal{P}(h_t) \subseteq \Action_{\text{market}}
\quad \forall t.
\]

% ==================================================
\section{Extraction Fields and Attention Dynamics}
% ==================================================

\subsection{Attention Budget}

Let $\Attention$ denote a finite attentional budget per agent over a time interval
$[t,t+1]$.

\[
\Attention = \int_t^{t+1} a(\tau)\, d\tau,
\quad a(\tau) \ge 0.
\]

\subsection{Extraction Field}

Define an extraction field
\[
\Psi : \State \to \mathbb{R}
\]
with associated gradient $\Grad \Psi(s)$.

\begin{definition}[Extraction Gradient]
The extraction gradient at state $s$ is
\[
\mathbf{g}_\Psi(s) = \Grad \Psi(s),
\]
representing directional pressure on attentional allocation.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Attention Allocation Operator}

Let
\[
\mathcal{A} : \State \to \Delta(\Attention)
\]
map states to probability distributions over attention allocation.

\subsection{Extraction Operator}

Define the extraction operator
\[
E_\Psi(s,a) = \mathbf{g}_\Psi(s) \cdot a,
\]
measuring involuntary diversion of attention under allocation $a$.

\subsection{Involuntary Capture Condition}

\begin{definition}[Involuntary Attention Capture]
Capture occurs at state $s$ if
\[
E_\Psi(s,a) > 0
\quad \text{for all admissible } a.
\]
\end{definition}

This condition holds when attention diversion is unavoidable regardless of agent
preference.

\subsection{Value Transfer}

Let $V_u$ denote user value and $V_p$ platform value.

Define expected transfers:
\[
\Delta V_u(s) = - \mathbb{E}[E_\Psi(s,a)],
\quad
\Delta V_p(s) = \mathbb{E}[E_\Psi(s,a)].
\]

\subsection{Asymmetric Extraction}

\begin{proposition}[Reverse Redistribution]
If
\[
\mathbb{E}[\Delta V_u(s)] < 0
\quad \text{and} \quad
\mathbb{E}[\Delta V_p(s)] > 0
\]
for almost all $s$, then the extraction field induces net upward redistribution.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Advertiser Failure Regime}

Let $A_i$ index advertisers.

Define advertiser return
\[
R_i = V_i^{\text{out}} - V_i^{\text{in}}.
\]

Empirically typical:
\[
\Pr(R_i < 0) \gg \Pr(R_i > 0).
\]

\subsection{Platform Profitability}

Platform profit satisfies
\[
\Pi_{\text{platform}} = \sum_i V_i^{\text{in}} - C_{\text{infra}},
\]
where $C_{\text{infra}}$ is sublinear in advertiser count.

\begin{lemma}[Failure-Compatible Profit]
Platform profitability does not require advertiser success:
\[
\frac{\partial \Pi_{\text{platform}}}{\partial R_i} \approx 0.
\]
\end{lemma}

\subsection{Interference with Cultural Filtering}

Let $\Culture$ be the endogenous cultural configuration and
$\Culture_\Psi$ the post-extraction configuration.

Define distortion:
\[
D(\Culture,\Culture_\Psi) =
\Entropy(\Culture_\Psi) - \Entropy(\Culture).
\]

\begin{proposition}[Cultural Entropy Increase]
Under involuntary extraction,
\[
D(\Culture,\Culture_\Psi) > 0.
\]
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Stability of Extraction Fields}

Extraction fields are stable if
\[
\Grad \Psi \neq 0
\quad \text{and} \quad
\Survive(s,a)=1 \;\; \forall s \text{ in platform domain}.
\]

Thus extraction persists whenever exit is costly.

% ==================================================
\section{Event-Historical Dynamics and Admissible Futures}
% ==================================================

\subsection{Event Space}

Let $\mathcal{E}$ denote the space of atomic events.

An event history is a finite sequence
\[
h_t = (e_0, e_1, \dots, e_t), \quad e_i \in \mathcal{E}.
\]

\subsection{Prefix Order}

Define the prefix order $\preceq$ on histories:
\[
h_t \preceq h_{t'} \iff t \le t' \;\; \text{and} \;\; h_t \text{ is a prefix of } h_{t'}.
\]

This induces a partial order on $\Hist$.

\subsection{Transition Operator}

Define the transition operator
\[
\mathcal{T} : \Hist \times \Action \to \Hist,
\quad
\mathcal{T}(h_t,a_t) = h_{t+1}.
\]

\subsection{Admissibility Constraint}

Let $\Hist_{\text{adm}} \subseteq \Hist$ denote admissible histories.

\begin{definition}[Admissible History]
A history $h_t$ is admissible iff
\[
\forall i \le t, \quad \Survive(h_i,a_i)=1.
\]
\end{definition}

\subsection{Future Operator}

Define the future operator
\[
\mathsf{Fut}(h_t) = \{ h_{t'} \in \Hist_{\text{adm}} \mid h_t \preceq h_{t'} \}.
\]

\subsection{Pruning Operator}

Define the pruning operator
\[
\mathcal{P} : \mathcal{P}(\Hist) \to \mathcal{P}(\Hist),
\quad
\mathcal{P}(X) = X \cap \Hist_{\text{adm}}.
\]

\subsection{Structural Power as Pruning}

\begin{definition}[Structural Pruning]
Structural power acts by repeated application of $\mathcal{P}$ at each time step:
\[
\mathsf{Fut}(h_{t+1}) = \mathcal{P}(\mathsf{Fut}(h_t)).
\]
\end{definition}

This process monotonically reduces the cardinality of admissible futures.

\subsection{Irreversibility}

Define reversibility of an event $e_t$:

\[
e_t \text{ is reversible} \iff \exists e'_t \text{ such that }
\mathcal{T}(\mathcal{T}(h_{t-1},e_t),e'_t) = h_{t-1}.
\]

\begin{lemma}[Generic Irreversibility]
For most survival-aligned events $e_t$,
\[
e_t \text{ is irreversible}.
\]
\end{lemma}

Examples include debt accumulation, rent payment, credential aging, and skill
obsolescence.

\subsection{Path Dependence}

Define path dependence:

\begin{definition}[Path Dependence]
A history $h_t$ is path-dependent if
\[
|\mathsf{Fut}(h_t)| < |\mathsf{Fut}(h_{t-1})|.
\]
\end{definition}

Structural reproduction increases path dependence monotonically.

\subsection{Intervention}

Define an intervention $I$ as an operator
\[
I : \Hist \to \Hist
\]
such that
\[
|\mathsf{Fut}(I(h_t))| > |\mathsf{Fut}(h_t)|.
\]

\begin{proposition}[Counter-Structural Intervention]
An intervention alters structure iff it expands admissible futures:
\[
\Delta |\mathsf{Fut}| > 0.
\]
\end{proposition}

Symbolic or discursive actions that do not modify admissibility leave
$\mathsf{Fut}$ unchanged.

\subsection{Terminal Histories}

Define terminal histories:
\[
\Hist_{\text{term}} =
\{ h \in \Hist \mid \mathsf{Fut}(h) = \varnothing \}.
\]

Terminal histories correspond to system exit (death, exclusion, collapse).

% ==================================================
\section{Thresholds, Coalitions, and Structural Phase Change}
% ==================================================

\subsection{Organizational Capacity}

Let $O(t) \in \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ denote organizational capacity at time $t$.

Components of $O(t)$ may include membership count, financial reserves,
coordination efficiency, institutional presence, and strike readiness.

\subsection{Accumulation Dynamics}

Define accumulation dynamics:
\[
O(t+1) = O(t) + \Delta O(t),
\]
where $\Delta O(t)$ may be positive or negative.

\subsection{Threshold Parameter}

Let $\theta \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}$ denote a structural threshold.

\begin{definition}[Effective Capacity]
Organizational capacity is effective iff
\[
O(t) \ge \theta.
\]
\end{definition}

\subsection{Below-Threshold Regime}

For $O(t) < \theta$,
\[
\Delta \Struct(t) \approx 0.
\]

Actions in this regime have expressive or symbolic effect but do not alter
constraint fields.

\subsection{Above-Threshold Regime}

For $O(t) \ge \theta$,
\[
\exists a_t \in \Action_{\text{res}} \text{ such that }
\Delta \Struct(t) \neq 0.
\]

This defines the onset of structural leverage.

\subsection{Phase Transition}

Define a phase transition at time $t^*$ iff
\[
O(t^* - 1) < \theta
\quad \text{and} \quad
O(t^*) \ge \theta.
\]

\begin{proposition}[Nonlinearity]
Structural change is nonlinear in $O(t)$ at $\theta$:
\[
\frac{d \Struct}{d O} \Big|_{O=\theta^-} \ll
\frac{d \Struct}{d O} \Big|_{O=\theta^+}.
\]
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Coalition Composition}

Let a coalition be a partition
\[
\mathcal{Q} = \{ Q_1, Q_2, \dots, Q_n \},
\]
where each $Q_i$ denotes a participating group.

\subsection{Leverage Function}

Define leverage contribution
\[
\ell : \mathcal{Q} \to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}.
\]

Working-class groups satisfy
\[
\ell(Q_i) \gg \ell(Q_j)
\quad \text{for most non-disruptive groups } Q_j.
\]

\subsection{Leadership Condition}

\begin{definition}[Leadership Constraint]
A coalition satisfies the leadership constraint iff
\[
\arg\max_{Q_i \in \mathcal{Q}} \ell(Q_i)
\]
determines strategic priorities.
\end{definition}

\subsection{PMC Mediation Operator}

Define mediation
\[
M : D \to A,
\]
mapping demands $D$ to actions $A$.

\subsection{Displacement Condition}

Displacement occurs if
\[
\ell(M(D)) < \ell(D).
\]

\begin{proposition}[Coalition Failure Mode]
If displacement persists, then
\[
\lim_{t \to \infty} O(t) < \theta.
\]
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Counter-Structural Support}

Let $C$ denote counter-structures.

Define supported capacity
\[
O_C(t) = O(t) + \sigma(C),
\]
where $\sigma(C) \ge 0$ measures support magnitude.

\subsection{Threshold Crossing with Support}

\begin{lemma}[Support-Induced Transition]
If
\[
O(t) < \theta \quad \text{and} \quad O_C(t) \ge \theta,
\]
then a phase transition occurs.
\end{lemma}

\subsection{Hysteresis}

Define post-transition capacity decay
\[
O(t+1) = O(t) - \delta,
\quad \delta > 0.
\]

Structural gains persist iff
\[
O(t) - \delta \ge \theta.
\]

Otherwise, regression occurs.

\subsection{Critical Slowing}

Near $\theta$, accumulation dynamics satisfy
\[
\Delta O(t) \to 0,
\]
producing apparent stagnation prior to transition.

\subsection{Terminal Coalitions}

Define terminal coalition states:
\[
\mathcal{Q}_{\text{term}} =
\{ \mathcal{Q} \mid \forall t,\; O(t) < \theta \}.
\]

Terminal coalitions exhaust resources without inducing phase change.
