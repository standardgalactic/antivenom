Crumpled Planet Blender Script

A blender bpy python program to generate a sphere with a crumpled skin nested inside a smooth blue sphere so that it looks like a planet with earth sticking out of it.
Edit
I'll create a Blender Python script that generates a planetary-like object with a crumpled inner sphere breaking through a smooth blue outer sphere.
Blender Python Script - Planet Break Effect
Code
This script creates a scene with:
A smooth outer sphere with a blue, slightly metallic material
An inner sphere with a rocky, crumpled texture that appears to break through the outer sphere
The effect is achieved through:
Noise-based displacement on the inner sphere's vertices
Procedural texturing for the rocky material
Careful sizing to create the "breaking through" effect
To use this script:
Open Blender
Switch to the Scripting workspace
Create a new text file
Paste this code
Run the script
You can modify various parameters to adjust the effect:
Change the radius values to adjust how much the inner sphere breaks through
Modify the noise parameters for different crumpling effects
Adjust the materials' colors and properties
Change the camera and lighting positions for different angles
Would you like me to modify any aspects of the scene, such as the colors, texturing, or camera angle?

can you color the water blue and the land green, and have a differnet crumple pattern each time
Edit
I'll modify the script to create earth-like colors and add randomized crumpling patterns.
Blender Python Script - Earth Break Effect
Code
I've made several improvements to the script:
Color Changes:
Changed the outer sphere to a deeper ocean blue with subtle wave patterns
Made the inner sphere green with variations to look like terrain
Added brown mountain areas for more realism
Randomization:
Added a random seed that affects both the crumpling pattern and the texture
Created multiple layers of noise for more natural-looking terrain
Each time you run the script, you'll get a different land pattern
Enhanced Materials:
Added wave texture to the ocean
Created more complex terrain texturing with mixed noise patterns
Improved lighting setup with additional fill light
To get different patterns, simply run the script multiple times - each execution will generate a unique landscape pattern due to the random seed.
Would you like me to adjust any of the colors or the amount of randomization? I can also modify the ratio of land to water by adjusting the sphere radiuses.

I would like to update my github deployed page to change the current image of a tritex to small-world.png and include the code you just wrote as a section maybe called "small-world.py":
Edit
I'll help you create a React component to display both the small-world.png image and the Blender script section.
Small World Documentation Section
Interactive artifact
I've created a React component that:
Displays the small-world.png image at the top
Shows the Blender script in a code block with syntax highlighting
Includes clear usage instructions
Uses consistent styling with Tailwind CSS
Incorporates icons from lucide-react
Is responsive and well-organized
To use this component:
Make sure the small-world.png image is placed in your public folder
Import and use the component where needed in your page layout
The component will automatically handle responsive sizing and layout
Would you like me to modify anything about the layout or add any additional features to the documentation section?

Claude can make mistakes.
