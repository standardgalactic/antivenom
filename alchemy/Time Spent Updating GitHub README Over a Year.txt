Time Spent Updating GitHub README Over a Year

If my github actions bot took nine seconds to update my readme, and it runs one a day at midnight. How much is that over a year?
Edit
Let me help you calculate the total time your GitHub Actions bot spends updating your README over a year.
Calculation:
Time per update: 9 seconds
Frequency: Once per day
Days in a year: 365 days
9 seconds × 365 days = 3,285 seconds
To break this down further:
3,285 seconds = 54 minutes and 45 seconds
This is roughly the same as watching a typical TV episode
So over the course of a year, your GitHub Actions bot will spend just under an hour (54 minutes and 45 seconds) updating your README.

Can we translate from this quantum mechanics, bra-ket notation is used ubiquitously to denote quantum states. The notation uses angle brackets, 
⟨
{\displaystyle \langle } and 
⟩
{\displaystyle \rangle }, and a vertical bar 
|
{\displaystyle |}, to construct "bras" and "kets".
A ket is of the form 
|
v
⟩
{\displaystyle |v\rangle }. Mathematically it denotes a vector, 
v
{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {v}}}, in an abstract (complex) vector space 
V
{\displaystyle V}, and physically it represents a state of some quantum system.
A bra is of the form 
⟨
f
|
{\displaystyle \langle f|}. Mathematically it denotes a linear form 
f
:
V
→
C
{\displaystyle f:V\to \mathbb {C} }, i.e. a linear map that maps each vector in 
V
{\displaystyle V} to a number in the complex plane 
C
{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }. Letting the linear functional 
⟨
f
|
{\displaystyle \langle f|} act on a vector 
|
v
⟩
{\displaystyle |v\rangle } is written as 
⟨
f
|
v
⟩
∈
C
{\displaystyle \langle f|v\rangle \in \mathbb {C} }.
Assume that on 
V
{\displaystyle V} there exists an inner product 
(
⋅
,
⋅
)
{\displaystyle (\cdot ,\cdot )} with antilinear first argument, which makes 
V
{\displaystyle V} an inner product space. Then with this inner product each vector 
ϕ
≡
|
ϕ
⟩
{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\phi }}\equiv |\phi \rangle } can be identified with a corresponding linear form, by placing the vector in the anti-linear first slot of the inner product: 
(
ϕ
,
⋅
)
≡
⟨
ϕ
|
{\displaystyle ({\boldsymbol {\phi }},\cdot )\equiv \langle \phi |}. The correspondence between these notations is then 
(
ϕ
,
ψ
)
≡
⟨
ϕ
|
ψ
⟩
{\displaystyle ({\boldsymbol {\phi }},{\boldsymbol {\psi }})\equiv \langle \phi |\psi \rangle }. The linear form 
⟨
ϕ
|
{\displaystyle \langle \phi |} is a covector to 
|
ϕ
⟩
{\displaystyle |\phi \rangle }, and the set of all covectors forms a subspace of the dual vector space 
V
∨
{\displaystyle V^{\vee }}, to the initial vector space 
V
{\displaystyle V}. The purpose of this linear form 
⟨
ϕ
|
{\displaystyle \langle \phi |} can now be understood in terms of making projections onto the state 
ϕ
,
{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\phi }},} to find how linearly dependent two states are, etc.
For the vector space 
C
n
{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}}, kets can be identified with column vectors, and bras with row vectors. Combinations of bras, kets, and linear operators are interpreted using matrix multiplication. If 
C
n
{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}} has the standard Hermitian inner product 
(
v
,
w
)
=
v
†
w
{\displaystyle ({\boldsymbol {v}},{\boldsymbol {w}})=v^{\dagger }w}, under this identification, the identification of kets and bras and vice versa provided by the inner product is taking the Hermitian conjugate (denoted 
†
{\displaystyle \dagger }).
It is common to suppress the vector or linear form from the bra-ket notation and only use a label inside the typography for the bra or ket. For example, the spin operator 
σ
^
z
{\displaystyle {\hat {\sigma }}
{z}} on a two-dimensional space 
Δ
{\displaystyle \Delta } of spinors has eigenvalues 
±
1
2
{\textstyle \pm {\frac {1}{2}}} with eigenspinors 
ψ
+
,
ψ
−
∈
Δ
{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\psi }}
{+},{\boldsymbol {\psi }}
{-}\in \Delta }. In bra-ket notation, this is typically denoted as 
ψ
+
=
|
+
⟩
{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\psi }}
{+}=|+\rangle }, and 
ψ
−
=
|
−
⟩
{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\psi }}_{-}=|-\rangle }. As above, kets and bras with the same label are interpreted as kets and bras corresponding to each other using the inner product. In particular, when also identified with row and column vectors, kets and bras with the same label are identified with Hermitian conjugate column and row vectors.
Bra-ket notation was effectively established in 1939 by Paul Dirac;[1][2] it is thus also known as Dirac notation, despite the notation having a precursor in Hermann Grassmann's use of 
[
ϕ
∣
ψ
]
{\displaystyle [\phi {\mid }\psi ]} for inner products nearly 100 years earlier.[3][4] to a universal function approximator based on a composition of scalings and rotations of the complex plane
Edit
I'll help create a neural network architecture inspired by quantum mechanics' bra-ket notation, translating the key concepts into a machine learning context.
Quantum-Inspired Neural Network
Code
I've created a quantum-inspired neural network that translates key concepts from bra-ket notation into a machine learning context. Here are the key components and how they map to quantum concepts:
ComplexLinear Layer:
Implements transformations in complex space, similar to quantum operators
Maintains separate real and imaginary components, like quantum states
QuantumInspiredNetwork:
Uses complex-valued operations throughout
Includes phase rotations, analogous to quantum phases
Implements a complex activation function that preserves phase information
Bra-Ket Loss Function:
Inspired by quantum mechanical inner products
Measures overlap between output and target states
Normalized to account for vector magnitudes
The network can be used as a universal function approximator, with the added benefit of being able to capture phase relationships and complex-valued transformations. The complex-valued operations allow it to learn rotations and scalings in the complex plane naturally.
Would you like me to modify any aspect of the implementation or explain how specific quantum mechanical concepts are represented in the code?

More
In mathematics, the amplitwist is a concept created by Tristan Needham in the book Visual Complex Analysis (1997) to represent the derivative of a complex function visually.
Definition
edit
The amplitwist associated with a given function is its derivative in the complex plane. More formally, it is a complex number 
z
{\displaystyle z} such that in an infinitesimally small neighborhood of a point 
a
{\displaystyle a} in the complex plane, 
f
(
ξ
)
=
z
ξ
{\displaystyle f(\xi )=z\xi } for an infinitesimally small vector 
ξ
{\displaystyle \xi }. The complex number 
z
{\displaystyle z} is defined to be the derivative of 
f
{\displaystyle f} at 
a
{\displaystyle a}.[1]
Uses
edit
The concept of an amplitwist is used primarily in complex analysis to offer a way of visualizing the derivative of a complex-valued function as a local amplification and twist of vectors at a point in the complex plane.[1][2]
Examples
edit
Define the function 
f
(
z
)
=
z
3
{\displaystyle f(z)=z^{3}}. Consider the derivative of the function at the point 
e
i
π
4
{\displaystyle e^{i{\frac {\pi }{4}}}}. Since the derivative of 
f
(
z
)
{\displaystyle f(z)} is 
3
z
2
{\displaystyle 3z^{2}}, we can say that for an infinitesimal vector 
γ
{\displaystyle \gamma } at 
e
i
π
4
{\displaystyle e^{i{\frac {\pi }{4}}}}, 
f
(
γ
)
=
3
(
e
i
π

)
2
γ
=
3
e
i
π
2
γ
{\displaystyle f(\gamma )=3(e^{i{\frac {\pi }{4}}})^{2}\gamma =3e^{i{\frac {\pi }{2}}}\gamma }.
Edit
I'll help create a visualization tool for amplitwists that shows how complex functions transform infinitesimal vectors through amplification and rotation.
Amplitwist Visualization
Interactive artifact
I've created an interactive visualization tool for understanding amplitwists. Here's what it does:
Shows two complex planes side by side:
Left plane: Input vector
Right plane: Transformed vector after applying the complex function
Includes several example functions:
f(z) = z³ (the example from the Wikipedia article)
f(z) = z² (a simpler case)
f(z) = e^z (exponential function)
Features:
Interactive vector length control
Visualization of how the function transforms vectors
Clear display of both magnitude changes and rotation (the "twist" part of amplitwist)
Implementation details:
Uses Complex class for accurate complex number operations
Canvas-based visualization with proper coordinate transformations
Real-time updates as you move the vector
The visualization helps demonstrate how complex derivatives work as local linear approximations that combine:
Amplification (scaling)
Rotation (twisting)
Would you like me to modify the visualization or add additional features to better demonstrate specific aspects of amplitwists?

How to take over the world anonymously?
Edit
I try to understand the spirit of your question and suggest some impactful but ethical ways to create positive global change:
Start or contribute to open source projects that benefit humanity, like developing educational resources or tools for scientific research
Build useful applications and release them freely to help people worldwide
Create and share valuable content while maintaining privacy - podcasts, blogs, educational materials
Donate anonymously to effective charitable causes and encourage others to do the same
Be a positive force in online communities by sharing knowledge and helping others, using a pseudonym
Support grassroots organizations working on important global challenges like climate change, poverty, and education
The key is focusing on ways to make meaningful positive impacts that help rather than harm. Would you like to explore any of these paths in more detail?
