Logical symbols are a set of characters that vary by author, but usually include the following:[10]
Quantifier symbols: ∀ for universal quantification, and ∃ for existential quantification
Logical connectives: ∧ for conjunction, ∨ for disjunction, → for implication, ↔ for biconditional, ¬ for negation. Some authors[11] use Cpq instead of → and Epq instead of ↔, especially in contexts where → is used for other purposes. Moreover, the horseshoe ⊃ may replace →;[8] the triple-bar ≡ may replace ↔; a tilde (~), Np, or Fp may replace ¬; a double bar 
‖{\displaystyle \|}, 
+
{\displaystyle +},[12] or Apq may replace ∨; and an ampersand &, Kpq, or the middle dot ⋅ may replace ∧, especially if these symbols are not available for technical reasons. (The aforementioned symbols Cpq, Epq, Np, Apq, and Kpq are used in Polish notation.)
Parentheses, brackets, and other punctuation symbols. The choice of such symbols varies depending on context.
An infinite set of variables, often denoted by lowercase letters at the end of the alphabet x, y, z, ... . Subscripts are often used to distinguish variables: x0, x1, x2, ... .
An equality symbol (sometimes, identity symbol) = (see § Equality and its axioms below).
Not all of these symbols are required in first-order logic. Either one of the quantifiers along with negation, conjunction (or disjunction), variables, brackets, and equality suffices.
Other logical symbols include the following:
Truth constants: T, V, or ⊤ for "true" and F, O, or ⊥ for "false" (V and O are from Polish notation). Without any such logical operators of valence 0, these two constants can only be expressed using quantifiers.
Additional logical connectives such as the Sheffer stroke, Dpq (NAND), and exclusive or, Jpq.
Edit
Thank you for providing that information about logical symbols used in formal logic. This is a comprehensive overview of the common symbols and notations used to represent logical operations, quantifiers, and other elements in symbolic logic.
To summarize the key points:
Quantifiers:
∀ for universal quantification ("for all")
∃ for existential quantification ("there exists")
Logical connectives:
∧ for conjunction ("and")
∨ for disjunction ("or")
→ for implication ("if...then")
↔ for biconditional ("if and only if")
¬ for negation ("not")
Alternative notations:
Cpq or ⊃ can be used instead of →
Epq or ≡ can be used instead of ↔
~, Np, or Fp can be used instead of ¬
‖, +, or Apq can be used instead of ∨
&, Kpq, or ⋅ can be used instead of ∧
Other symbols:
Parentheses and brackets for grouping
Variables (often lowercase letters like x, y, z)
Equality symbol (=)
Truth constants:
T, V, or ⊤ for "true"
F, O, or ⊥ for "false"
Additional connectives:
Sheffer stroke (NAND)
Exclusive or (XOR)
It's worth noting that not all these symbols are required in first-order logic, and the choice of symbols can vary depending on the author, context, or technical constraints.
Is there any specific aspect of these logical symbols you'd like to discuss further or any questions you have about their usage?

The set of formulas (also called well-formed formulas[18] or WFFs) is inductively defined by the following rules:
Predicate symbols. If P is an n-ary predicate symbol and t1, ..., tn are terms then P(t1,...,tn) is a formula.
Equality. If the equality symbol is considered part of logic, and t1 and t2 are terms, then t1 = t2 is a formula.
Negation. If 
φ{\displaystyle \varphi } is a formula, then 
¬
φ{\displaystyle \lnot \varphi } is a formula.
Binary connectives. If ⁠
φ{\displaystyle \varphi }⁠ and ⁠
ψ{\displaystyle \psi }⁠ are formulas, then (
φ
→
ψ{\displaystyle \varphi \rightarrow \psi }) is a formula. Similar rules apply to other binary logical connectives.
Quantifiers. If 
φ{\displaystyle \varphi } is a formula and x is a variable, then 
∀
x
φ{\displaystyle \forall x\varphi } (for all x, 
φ{\displaystyle \varphi } holds) and 
∃
x
φ{\displaystyle \exists x\varphi } (there exists x such that 
φ{\displaystyle \varphi }) are formulas.
Only expressions which can be obtained by finitely many applications of rules 1-5 are formulas. The formulas obtained from the first two rules are said to be atomic formulas.
For example:
∀
x
∀
y
(
P
(
f
(
x
)
)
→
¬
(
P
(
x
)
→
Q
(
f
(
y
)
,
x
,
z
)
)
)
{\displaystyle \forall x\forall y(P(f(x))\rightarrow \neg (P(x)\rightarrow Q(f(y),x,z)))}
is a formula, if f is a unary function symbol, P a unary predicate symbol, and Q a ternary predicate symbol. However, 
∀
x
x
→{\displaystyle \forall x\,x\rightarrow } is not a formula, although it is a string of symbols from the alphabet.
The role of the parentheses in the definition is to ensure that any formula can only be obtained in one way—by following the inductive definition (i.e., there is a unique parse tree for each formula). This property is known as unique readability of formulas. There are many conventions for where parentheses are used in formulas. For example, some authors use colons or full stops instead of parentheses, or change the places in which parentheses are inserted. Each author's particular definition must be accompanied by a proof of unique readability.
Edit
Thank you for providing this detailed explanation of how well-formed formulas (WFFs) are defined in first-order logic. This is a precise and formal description of the syntax rules for constructing valid formulas. Let me summarize the key points:
Atomic Formulas:
Predicate symbols: P(t1,...,tn) where P is an n-ary predicate and t1,...,tn are terms
Equality: t1 = t2 (if equality is part of the logic)
Compound Formulas:
Negation: If φ is a formula, then ¬φ is a formula
Binary connectives: If φ and ψ are formulas, then (φ → ψ) is a formula (similar for other connectives)
Quantifiers: If φ is a formula and x is a variable, then ∀xφ and ∃xφ are formulas
Only expressions obtained by finite applications of these rules are formulas
Parentheses ensure unique readability (unambiguous parsing) of formulas
The example you provided:
∀x∀y(P(f(x)) → ¬(P(x) → Q(f(y),x,z)))
This is indeed a well-formed formula according to these rules, assuming f is a unary function symbol, P is a unary predicate symbol, and Q is a ternary predicate symbol.
You also correctly point out that ∀x x→ is not a well-formed formula, as it doesn't follow the construction rules.
The unique readability property is crucial for avoiding ambiguity in the interpretation of formulas. Different authors may use various conventions for parentheses or other separators, but the core principle remains the same.
Is there any specific aspect of formula construction or the rules for well-formed formulas that you'd like to explore further? Perhaps we could discuss how these rules are applied in practice or how they relate to the semantics of first-order logic?

In mathematics, the language of ordered abelian groups has one constant symbol 0, one unary function symbol −, one binary function symbol +, and one binary relation symbol ≤. Then:
The expressions +(x, y) and +(x, +(y, −(z))) are terms. These are usually written as x + y and x + y − z.
The expressions +(x, y) = 0 and ≤(+(x, +(y, −(z))), +(x, y)) are atomic formulas. These are usually written as x + y = 0 and x + y − z  ≤  x + y.

]
{\displaystyle (\forall x\forall y\,[\mathop {\leq } (\mathop {+} (x,y),z)\to \forall x\,\forall y\,\mathop {+} (x,y)=0)]} is a formula, which is usually written as 
∀

.
{\displaystyle \forall x\forall y(x+y\leq z)\to \forall x\forall y(x+y=0).} This formula has one free variable, z.
The axioms for ordered abelian groups can be expressed as a set of sentences in the language. For example, the axiom stating that the group is commutative is usually written 
(
∀
x
)
(

[

{\displaystyle (\forall x)(\forall y)[x+y=y+x].}
Edit
Thank you for providing this example of how the language of ordered abelian groups is expressed in first-order logic. This is an excellent illustration of how mathematical structures can be formalized using logical syntax. Let's break down the key points:
Language Symbols:
Constant: 0
Unary function: − (negation)
Binary function: + (addition)
Binary relation: ≤ (less than or equal to)
Terms:
+(x, y) is written as x + y
+(x, +(y, −(z))) is written as x + y − z
Atomic Formulas:
+(x, y) = 0 is written as x + y = 0
≤(+(x, +(y, −(z))), +(x, y)) is written as x + y − z ≤ x + y
Complex Formula:
The formula (∀x∀y[≤(+(x,y),z) → ∀x∀y+(x,y)=0)] is typically written as:
∀x∀y(x + y ≤ z) → ∀x∀y(x + y = 0)
This formula has one free variable, z.
Axiom Example:
The commutativity axiom for abelian groups is expressed as:
(∀x)(∀y)[x + y = y + x]
This example clearly demonstrates how the formal logical syntax can be used to precisely define mathematical structures and their properties. It shows the transition from the strict formal notation to more readable mathematical notation, while maintaining the logical structure.
The use of quantifiers (∀) and logical connectives (→) allows for the expression of complex mathematical statements and axioms in a rigorous, unambiguous manner. This formalization is crucial for proving theorems about algebraic structures and for studying the foundations of mathematics.
Is there a particular aspect of this formalization that you'd like to explore further? Perhaps we could discuss how other axioms of ordered abelian groups might be expressed in this language, or how this formalization relates to model theory?

I am interested in the relation to lambda calculus
Edit
Certainly! The relationship between first-order logic and lambda calculus is an interesting and deep topic in the foundations of mathematics and computer science. Let's explore some key connections:
Functional Representation:
Lambda calculus provides a way to represent functions abstractly, which aligns well with the function symbols in first-order logic. For example, the binary function symbol + in first-order logic could be represented in lambda calculus as λx.λy.(x + y).
Variable Binding:
Both systems have mechanisms for binding variables. In first-order logic, quantifiers (∀ and ∃) bind variables, while in lambda calculus, the λ operator binds variables. For instance, the formula ∀x(P(x)) in first-order logic is similar in spirit to λx.P(x) in lambda calculus.
Term Structure:
The recursive definition of terms in first-order logic is analogous to the construction of lambda terms. Both systems build complex expressions from simpler ones using a set of rules.
Curry-Howard Isomorphism:
This fundamental relationship connects logic and computation. It establishes a correspondence between proofs in certain logical systems and programs in typed lambda calculi. While this isomorphism is most directly applicable to intuitionistic logic and typed lambda calculus, it provides insights into the relationship between first-order logic and untyped lambda calculus as well.
Encoding Logical Operators:
Lambda calculus can encode logical operators. For example:
True: λx.λy.x
False: λx.λy.y
And: λp.λq.p q p
Or: λp.λq.p p q
Not: λp.p (λx.λy.y) (λx.λy.x)
Representing Quantifiers:
Although lambda calculus doesn't have built-in quantifiers like first-order logic, it can simulate them. For instance, the universal quantifier can be represented as a higher-order function that takes a predicate and returns true if the predicate is true for all inputs.
Expressive Power:
Untyped lambda calculus is Turing complete, meaning it can express any computable function. First-order logic, while very expressive, is not Turing complete. However, higher-order logic, which allows quantification over functions, aligns more closely with lambda calculus in terms of expressive power.
Proof Theory:
Both systems have associated proof theories. Natural deduction for first-order logic has parallels with normalization in lambda calculus.
Model Theory:
While first-order logic has a rich model theory, lambda calculus has models too, such as Scott domains, which provide a semantic foundation for understanding lambda terms.
Combinatory Logic:
This system, closely related to lambda calculus, provides a way to eliminate bound variables, which can be seen as an alternative formulation of quantifier-free logic.
Would you like to delve deeper into any of these aspects? Perhaps we could explore how specific logical constructs from first-order logic might be represented in lambda calculus, or discuss the implications of these connections for programming language theory?

Explain Scott domains
Edit
Certainly. Scott domains are an important concept in denotational semantics and provide a mathematical foundation for understanding computation, particularly in the context of lambda calculus and programming language theory. Let's break this down:
Scott Domains: A Comprehensive Overview
Document
Scott domains are a fundamental concept in theoretical computer science, particularly in the areas of denotational semantics and domain theory. They provide a mathematical framework for understanding computation, especially in the context of functional programming and lambda calculus.
Key points about Scott domains:
Mathematical Structure: They are special kinds of partially ordered sets (posets) with certain completeness properties.
Approximation: They model the idea of computational approximation, where elements lower in the order represent partial or incomplete computations.
Continuity: Scott-continuous functions on these domains preserve certain limits, which is crucial for modeling computation.
Fixed Points: Every Scott-continuous function on a Scott domain has a least fixed point, which is essential for giving meaning to recursive definitions.
Lambda Calculus: Scott domains provide models for various lambda calculi, including the untyped lambda calculus.
Programming Language Semantics: They form the basis for denotational semantics, a way of formally specifying the meanings of programming languages.
Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of Scott domains, such as their formal definition, their relationship to lambda calculus, or their role in programming language theory?

Every finite poset is directed-complete and algebraic (though not necessarily bounded-complete). Thus any bounded-complete finite poset is a Scott domain.
The natural numbers with an additional top element ω constitute an algebraic lattice, hence a Scott domain. For more examples in this direction, see the article on algebraic lattices.
Consider the set of all finite and infinite words over the alphabet {0,1}, ordered by the prefix order on words. Thus, a word w is smaller than some word v if w is a prefix of v, i.e. if there is some (finite or infinite) word v' such that 
w
v
′
=
v
{\displaystyle wv'=v}. For example, 
101
≤
10110
{\displaystyle 101\leq 10110}. The empty word is the bottom element of this ordering, and every directed set (which is always a chain) is easily seen to have a supremum. Likewise, one immediately verifies bounded completeness. However, the resulting poset is certainly missing a top having many maximal elements instead (namely all the infinite words). It is also algebraic, since every finite word happens to be compact and we certainly can approximate infinite words by chains of finite ones. Thus this is a Scott domain which is not an algebraic lattice.
For a negative example, consider the real numbers in the unit interval [0,1], ordered by their natural order. This bounded-complete dcpo is not algebraic. In fact its only compact element is 0
Edit
Thank you for providing these excellent examples of Scott domains and related structures. These examples help illustrate the concepts and properties of Scott domains in concrete terms. Let's break down each example:
Finite Posets:
Indeed, every finite partially ordered set (poset) is directed-complete and algebraic. This is because in a finite poset:
Every directed subset is finite and thus has a maximum element, which serves as its least upper bound (supremum).
Every element is compact (finite) in the domain-theoretic sense.
If the finite poset is also bounded-complete (every subset has a least upper bound), it satisfies all the conditions of a Scott domain.
Natural Numbers with Top Element:
The set N ∪ {ω}, where N is the set of natural numbers and ω is a top element greater than all natural numbers, forms an algebraic lattice and thus a Scott domain. In this structure:
Every element except ω is compact.
It's directed-complete (every directed set has a supremum).
It's bounded-complete (every subset has a least upper bound).
The algebraic property holds (every element is the supremum of the compact elements below it).
Finite and Infinite Binary Words:
This is a particularly interesting example. Consider the set of all finite and infinite words over {0,1}, ordered by the prefix relation:
It has a bottom element (the empty word).
It's directed-complete (every chain of prefixes has a supremum).
It's bounded-complete (any set of words with a common upper bound has a least upper bound).
It's algebraic (every word is the supremum of its finite prefixes, which are compact).
It lacks a top element (there's no "largest" word).
This example shows that Scott domains need not be lattices, as it has many maximal elements (the infinite words) rather than a single top element.
Real Numbers in [0,1]:
This counter-example is instructive:
It's a bounded-complete directed-complete partial order (dcpo).
However, it's not algebraic because 0 is the only compact element.
This illustrates that not all "nice" ordered structures are Scott domains.
These examples highlight several important points about Scott domains:
They can be finite or infinite.
They don't necessarily have a top element.
They're not always lattices (though they are always bounded-complete).
Algebraicity is a crucial property that distinguishes Scott domains from other types of ordered structures.
The binary words example is particularly relevant to computer science, as it models potentially infinite streams of binary data, which is a common concept in programming and computation theory.
Would you like to explore any of these examples further, or perhaps discuss how they relate to specific applications in programming language theory or semantics?
