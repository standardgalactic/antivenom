Key Propositional Calculus Concepts
Share
NG
Could you give a list of terms needed in propositional calculus?
Edit
Here's a concise list of key terms used in propositional calculus:
Proposition
Logical connectives (AND, OR, NOT, IF-THEN, IF AND ONLY IF)
Truth values (True, False)
Atomic proposition
Compound proposition
Truth table
Tautology
Contradiction
Contingency
Logical equivalence
Validity
Soundness
Argument
Premise
Conclusion
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these terms or provide examples?

Contingency
Edit
Certainly, I'd be happy to explain the concept of contingency in propositional calculus.
A contingency is a compound proposition that is neither a tautology nor a contradiction. In other words:
It's not always true (unlike a tautology)
It's not always false (unlike a contradiction)
Its truth value depends on the truth values of its component propositions
Key characteristics of a contingency:
In its truth table, it has at least one true outcome and at least one false outcome.
Its truth value is contingent upon (depends on) the truth values of its atomic propositions.
Example:
Let's consider the proposition P: "If it's sunny, then it's warm."
We can represent this as: S → W
Where S means "It's sunny" and W means "It's warm"
This is a contingency because:
It's true in some cases (sunny and warm, or not sunny and not warm)
It's false in some cases (sunny but not warm)
Its truth depends on the actual weather conditions
Truth table:
S | W | S → W
T | T |   T
T | F |   F
F | T |   T
F | F |   T
As you can see, this proposition is sometimes true and sometimes false, depending on the truth values of S and W, making it a contingency.
Would you like me to clarify anything further about contingencies or provide another example?

Further examples and notations
Edit
Certainly, I'll provide further examples and notations for contingencies in propositional calculus.
Notations:
In propositional calculus, we often use symbols to represent logical operations. Here are some common notations:
∧ (AND)
∨ (OR)
¬ (NOT)
→ (IF-THEN)
↔ (IF AND ONLY IF)
Examples of contingencies with different logical connectives:
P ∨ Q (P OR Q)
This is a contingency because it's true when either P or Q (or both) are true, but false when both are false.
Truth table:
P | Q | P ∨ Q
T | T |   T
T | F |   T
F | T |   T
F | F |   F
P ∧ ¬P (P AND NOT P)
This is always false, so it's a contradiction, not a contingency.
P ↔ Q (P IF AND ONLY IF Q)
This is a contingency because it's true when P and Q have the same truth value, and false when they differ.
Truth table:
P | Q | P ↔ Q
T | T |   T
T | F |   F
F | T |   F
F | F |   T
(P → Q) ∧ (Q → R)
This is a contingency. It's true in some cases (when the implications hold) and false in others.
Partial truth table (to demonstrate contingency):
P | Q | R | (P → Q) ∧ (Q → R)
T | T | T |        T
T | F | T |        F
F | T | F |        F
P ∨ ¬P (P OR NOT P)
This is always true, so it's a tautology, not a contingency.
Remember, to prove a proposition is a contingency, you only need to show:
At least one case where it's true
At least one case where it's false
This is often easier than constructing the full truth table, especially for more complex propositions.
Would you like me to explain any of these examples further or provide more complex contingencies?
