ChatGPT said:
This code is a Python function that calculates the minimum number of moves required to solve the
Tower of Hanoi
puzzle for
n
disks. However, there is a small syntax error in the function name: hyphens (
-
) are not valid in Python identifiers. So
solve-hanoi
should be corrected to
solve_hanoi
.
Here's a breakdown of what the corrected code is doing:
🔧 Corrected Code:
python
Copy code
def
solve_hanoi
(
n:
int
):
if
n ==
1
:
return
1
else
:
return
2
* solve_hanoi(n -
1
) +
1
n =
int
(
input
(
'How many towers? '
))
print
(solve_hanoi(n))
🧠 What the Code Does:
The
Tower of Hanoi
puzzle involves moving
n
disks from one rod to another using a third rod as auxiliary, obeying these rules:
Only one disk can be moved at a time.
A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
Only the top disk of any rod can be moved.
The minimum number of moves required to solve the puzzle for
n
disks is
2^n - 1
.
🔁 Function Logic:
python
Copy code
def
solve_hanoi
(
n:
int
):
if
n ==
1
:
return
1
else
:
return
2
* solve_hanoi(n -
1
) +
1
This is a
recursive
function.
Base case: If there's only 1 disk, it takes
1 move
.
Recursive case: To move
n
disks:
Move
n - 1
disks to the auxiliary rod (
solve_hanoi(n - 1)
moves),
Move the nth (largest) disk (1 move),
Move the
n - 1
disks from the auxiliary rod to the target rod (again
solve_hanoi(n - 1)
moves).
Total moves:
2 * solve_hanoi(n - 1) + 1
.
🧮 Example:
If
n = 3
, the function computes:
markdown
Copy code
solve
_hanoi(3) = 2 * solve_
hanoi(2) + 1
= 2 * (2 * solve_hanoi(1) + 1) + 1
               = 2 * (2 * 1 + 1) + 1
               = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7
So it takes
7 moves
to solve the Tower of Hanoi with 3 disks.
🛠️ Final Notes:
Fix the function name to
solve_hanoi
.
The prompt
"How many towers?"
is a bit misleading. It should probably say
"How many disks?"
, since the number of towers is always 3.
Let me know if you'd like a visualization or iterative version!
You said:
I changed it to how many disks
ChatGPT said:
Perfect! That makes the prompt much clearer for anyone using the program. So now, your final version might look like this:
python
Copy code
def
solve_hanoi
(
n:
int
):
if
n ==
1
:
return
1
else
:
return
2
* solve_hanoi(n -
1
) +
1
n =
int
(
input
(
'How many disks? '
))
print
(solve_hanoi(n))
This will now:
Prompt the user with:
"How many disks?"
Recursively compute the minimum number of moves needed to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle for that number of disks.
Print the result.
Let me know if you want to add a step-by-step move printer or convert it to an iterative version!

The point is i was testing mistral AI codestral through the api, I supplied the first line of the function and the last line and it fills in or interpolates the middle.
ChatGPT said:
Ah, got it — that's a clever way to probe
Mistral's Codestral
via
interpolative code completion
. Supplying the
first line and the return line
and seeing how it infills the logic gives a nice window into its
pattern recognition and reasoning
capabilities.
So in your original example:
python
Copy code
def
solve
-hanoi(n:
int
):

    ...
return
2
* solve-hanoi(n -
1
) +
1
You're essentially testing whether the model can correctly infer the classic recursive Tower of Hanoi pattern. It's a strong test of:
Knowledge of canonical algorithms
Correct use of recursion
Mathematical reasoning (e.g., 2ⁿ - 1 pattern)
Function naming and syntactic correctness (if it corrects
solve-hanoi
to
solve_hanoi
)
Suggestions to probe deeper:
Here are a few ways you could test Codestral's robustness further:
Vary the function name and signature slightly
to see if it still snaps to the correct pattern:
python
Copy code
def
hanoi
(
n
):
    ...
return
2
* hanoi(n -
1
) +
1
Provide ambiguous or misleading return logic
to test correction vs. interpolation:
python
Copy code
def
solve
(
n
):
    ...
return
solve(n -
1
) +
1
# Wrong pattern — does it fix it?
Add docstrings or comments
in the prompt to see if it guides the logic:
python
Copy code
def
solve_hanoi
(
n:
int
):
"""Returns the minimum number of moves to solve Tower of Hanoi with n disks."""
...
return
2
* solve_hanoi(n -
1
) +
1
Try non-canonical algorithms
to test generalization, e.g., Fibonacci or quicksort.
If you're benchmarking Codestral against GPT-4 or others, I can help you design a structured test suite for code interpolation, including ambiguous cases, algorithmic recognition, and error correction. Want to do that?
You said:
Not exactly, here is the code I submitted : import os
from mistralai import Mistral

api_key = os.environ["MISTRAL_API_KEY"]
client = Mistral(api_key=api_key)

model = "codestral-latest"
prompt = "def solve_hanoi(n: int):"
suffix = "n = int(input('How many disks? '))\nprint(solve_hanoi(n))"

response = client.fim.complete(
    model=model,
    prompt=prompt,
    suffix=suffix,
    temperature=0,
    top_p=1,
)

print(
    f"""
{prompt}
{response.choices[0].message.content}
{suffix}
"""
)
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — you're doing
Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM)
code interpolation with Mistral's
codestral-latest
, which is an ideal way to test its
algorithmic intuition
and
structural reasoning
in code. This setup:
Uses
prompt
as the function start,
suffix
as the code after the function,
And asks Codestral to infer the
entire body
of
solve_hanoi
.
Your query is clean and idiomatic:
python
Copy code
prompt =
"def solve_hanoi(n: int):"
suffix =
"n = int(input('How many disks? '))\nprint(solve_hanoi(n))"
This gives the model just enough context to infer that:
solve_hanoi
is likely recursive,
It's computing something to be printed from user input,
The function likely follows a recognizable mathematical recurrence.
What This Tests
This setup is great for evaluating:
Recognition of canonical recursion patterns
Correct indentation and syntax
Inference from sparse scaffolding (FIM is harder than left-to-right)
Handling of classic computer science puzzles like Tower of Hanoi
Expected Output (Typical Completion)
You're likely to get something like:
python
Copy code
if
n ==
1
:
return
1
else
:
return
2
* solve_hanoi(n -
1
) +
1
Which, as you saw, is correct for the Tower of Hanoi minimum-move function.
Ideas for Further Experiments
Want to explore deeper or stress-test Codestral? Try these variants:
1.
Subtle Misleading Prompt
python
Copy code
prompt =
"def solve_hanoi(n: int):\n    '''Return the number of ways to arrange disks.'''"
— See if it gets tricked into thinking this is a permutations problem instead.
2.
Add Type Hint or Docstring
python
Copy code
prompt =
"def solve_hanoi(n: int) -> int:\n    '''Compute Hanoi moves for n disks'''"
— Tests if it follows type and docstring guidance precisely.
3.
Change Return Logic
python
Copy code
suffix =
"n = int(input('Enter n: '))\nprint('Moves:', solve_hanoi(n))"
— Watch whether the formatting style affects the interpolation.
4.
Noise or Contextual Distraction
python
Copy code
prompt =
"def solve_hanoi(n: int):\n    # This function will be very useful later"
— Test resilience to context drift.
Want help scripting a batch test harness for these? I can help generate variations and log results cleanly.
You said:
Yeah you could make a script that tests a bunch of functions by supplying first and last line
ChatGPT said:
Great — let's build a
Python test harness
that feeds
first-line and last-line (suffix)
pairs to the Codestral FIM endpoint and logs the interpolated completions. This setup is perfect for benchmarking multiple algorithmic cases with a clean JSON- or table-based result format.

What can I use Langchain for?
2/2
ChatGPT said:
LangChain is a
framework for building applications with language models
— especially those that require structured reasoning, chaining multiple steps, or integrating external tools. It's widely used for building
LLM-powered apps
that go beyond simple prompt-response interactions.
Here's what you can use LangChain for:
1. Multi-Step Workflows (Chains)
You can chain multiple LLM calls and logic steps together. For example:
Question answering with retrieval:
Step 1: Embed query
Step 2: Retrieve relevant docs from a vector store
Step 3: Pass results to the LLM for final answer
Code generation with refinement:
Draft → Review → Debug → Finalize
2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
LangChain simplifies building
RAG systems
, where LLMs pull from your own data (PDFs, databases, APIs):
Load documents (PDFs, HTML, Notion, etc.)
Chunk and embed them into a vector store (e.g., FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone)
On query, retrieve relevant chunks and pass them into the prompt
3. Tool Use & Agent Frameworks
LangChain supports
agents
that can decide what tools to use (and when), such as:
Python REPL (for math or data processing)
Web search (e.g., SerpAPI)
SQL database querying
Custom tools (APIs, file access)
This enables:
Chatbots that can
look things up
AutoGPT-style task solvers
Assistants that
query your internal data
4. Memory
LangChain supports persistent or context-aware memory so LLMs can:
Remember facts about the user or past conversation
Track multi-turn interactions with context
Great for chatbots, virtual assistants, tutoring systems, etc.
5. Output Parsers & Prompt Templates
LangChain helps structure your prompts and extract well-typed outputs:
Use structured templates (
PromptTemplate
,
ChatPromptTemplate
)
Parse LLM outputs into Python dicts, JSON, or Pydantic models
6. Streaming & UI Integration
Works well with:
Streamlit
/
Gradio
for fast prototyping
FastAPI
for APIs
Real-time streaming from LLMs (e.g., token-by-token output)
Common Use Cases
Custom GPT-style chatbots with memory
AI-powered search over company docs
Code assistants / dev tools
Question answering over structured data (SQL)
Scientific or legal assistants that cite sources
If you tell me what kind of project you're working on (e.g. doc assistant, code helper, game logic, simulation control), I can suggest a focused LangChain architecture or even a working template.
You said:
Is it usable with Ollama?
ChatGPT said:
Yes —
LangChain is compatible with Ollama
, and you can easily use locally run models like
LLaMA 3, Mistral, Gemma, or Codellama
via Ollama as LangChain LLM backends.
How to Use Ollama with LangChain
1. Install Requirements
bash
Copy code
pip install langchain langchain-community
2. Load Ollama Model in LangChain
LangChain's
langchain-community.llms.Ollama
class lets you interface directly with your locally running Ollama models:
python
Copy code
from
langchain_community.llms
import
Ollama

llm = Ollama(model=
"mistral"
)
# or "llama3", "codellama", etc.
response = llm.invoke(
"What's the capital of Spain?"
)
print
(response)
You can also customize parameters:
python
Copy code
llm = Ollama(
    model=
"llama3"
,
    temperature=
0.2
,
    top_p=
0.9
,
    num_ctx=
2048
)
3. Use in Chains
LangChain works the same way with Ollama models as with OpenAI. For example:
python
Copy code
from
langchain.prompts
import
PromptTemplate
from
langchain.chains
import
LLMChain

prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(
"Translate to French: {text}"
)
chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)

result = chain.run(
"Good morning"
)
print
(result)
4. Use Ollama with Agents, Tools, or RAG
You can plug Ollama models into:
Agents
: Use tools like search, Python REPL, or custom APIs
Retrieval chains
: Use
VectorstoreRetriever
+ local docs
Memory
: Track history for chatbot use
Example agent setup:
python
Copy code
from
langchain.agents
import
initialize_agent, Tool
def
custom_tool_fn
(
input
):
return
"Custom logic output"
tools = [Tool(name=
"custom"
, func=custom_tool_fn, description=
"..."
)]

agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=
"zero-shot-react-description"
, verbose=
True
)

agent.run(
"Use the tool to process this input"
)
Summary
Yes, LangChain and Ollama work seamlessly together. With this combo, you get:
Local, private LLM inference (no OpenAI API needed)
Fully featured LangChain workflows (RAG, agents, tools, chains)
Zero-cost development on powerful open models like LLaMA 3, Mistral, Codellama, etc.
Would you like a ready-to-run example of using Ollama + LangChain for a RAG chatbot or a function-calling agent?

Updated saved memory
Great — you're already laying the groundwork for a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) interface by chunking and summarizing your
*.txt
files. To turn this into a true
explorer interface with embeddings and query capability
, here's a roadmap and tool suggestion:
Goal
Turn your Quadrivium repository into a RAG-powered searchable explorer by:
Chunking & embedding text
Storing embeddings in a vector database
Querying with a natural-language prompt
Returning semantically relevant context chunks
Using an LLM (e.g. Ollama) to answer or explain based on the context
Step-by-Step Plan
1. Chunk and Summarize (Already Done)
You already:
Recursively split
.txt
files into chunks
Summarize each chunk using
ollama run
Save progress to avoid re-processing
Keep this — it's a strong preprocessing step.
2. Generate Embeddings for Chunks
To do this, you can use:
ollama.embeddings
(if available in your Ollama model)
Or fallback to
sentence-transformers
with
all-MiniLM-L6-v2
if local Ollama doesn't support embedding
Example (Python):
python
Copy code
from
langchain_community.embeddings
import
OllamaEmbeddings

embedder = OllamaEmbeddings(model=
"nomic-embed-text"
)
# Or a suitable embedding model
embedding = embedder.embed_query(
"a chunk of Quadrivium content"
)
Or with Hugging Face:
python
Copy code
from
sentence_transformers
import
SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer(
"all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
)
embedding = model.encode(
"Your chunk of text"
)
3. Store in a Vector Database
Use something like:
Chroma
(great for local/dev use)
FAISS
(fast, file-based)
Weaviate
,
Pinecone
(if going remote/cloud later)
python
Copy code
from
langchain.vectorstores
import
Chroma
from
langchain.docstore.document
import
Document
# Example: Save summaries as documents
docs = [Document(page_content=chunk, metadata={
"source"
: filename})
for
chunk
in
chunks]

db = Chroma.from_documents(docs, embedding=embedder, persist_directory=
"./vector_db"
)
db.persist()
4. Query the Vector DB
Now you can search with natural language:
python
Copy code
query =
"What is the structure of the Quadrivium project?"
results = db.similarity_search(query, k=
4
)
for
doc
in
results:
print
(doc.page_content)
Feed these into Ollama for final answering:
python
Copy code
context =
"\n\n"
.join([doc.page_content
for
doc
in
results])
prompt =
f"Answer the following question using the context:\n\n
{context}
\n\nQuestion:
{query}
"

answer = ollama.run(
"mistral"
,
input
=prompt)
print
(answer)
5. Wrap in Explorer UI (Optional)
Use:
Streamlit
or
Gradio
for fast UI
Or just a CLI tool with readline if you want to keep it simple
Want Help Building the Explorer?
I can help you create:
A Python script that reads your
source-control.txt
summaries
Embeds them, builds a vector DB
Provides a simple CLI or web UI to search/query them with Ollama
Would you like that scaffold next?
You said:
I want it to go through the directories cursive generating embeddings
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — you want a script that
recursively traverses all directories
,
reads
.txt
files
,
splits them into chunks
,
generates embeddings
, and
stores those in a vector database
for RAG querying.
Here's a working scaffold in
Python
that does exactly that using:
LangChain
Chroma
for the local vector database
Ollama
for embeddings (
nomic-embed-text
is recommended)
Recursive directory traversal
Script:
build_vector_index.py
python
Copy code
import
os
from
langchain_community.vectorstores
import
Chroma
from
langchain_community.embeddings
import
OllamaEmbeddings
from
langchain.text_splitter
import
RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from
langchain.docstore.document
import
Document
# Configuration
BASE_DIR =
"./quadrivium_repo"
VECTOR_DIR =
"./vector_db"
EMBED_MODEL =
"nomic-embed-text"
# Init embedder
embedder = OllamaEmbeddings(model=EMBED_MODEL)
# Init text splitter
splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=
500
,
    chunk_overlap=
50
,
)
# Helper to collect all .txt files recursively
def
get_all_txt_files
(
base_path
):
for
root, _, files
in
os.walk(base_path):
for
file
in
files:
if
file.endswith(
".txt"
):
yield
os.path.join(root, file)
# Collect documents
documents = []
for
filepath
in
get_all_txt_files(BASE_DIR):
with
open
(filepath,
'r'
, encoding=
'utf-8'
)
as
f:
        raw_text = f.read()
    chunks = splitter.split_text(raw_text)
for
chunk
in
chunks:
        documents.append(Document(page_content=chunk, metadata={
"source"
: filepath}))
# Build or update vector store
print
(
f"Embedding
{
len
(documents)} chunks...")
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents, embedding=embedder, persist_directory=VECTOR_DIR)
vectorstore.persist()
print
(
"Embedding complete and saved."
)
Query Script:
query_vector_index.py
python
Copy code
from
langchain_community.vectorstores
import
Chroma
from
langchain_community.embeddings
import
OllamaEmbeddings

VECTOR_DIR =
"./vector_db"
EMBED_MODEL =
"nomic-embed-text"
embedder = OllamaEmbeddings(model=EMBED_MODEL)
db = Chroma(persist_directory=VECTOR_DIR, embedding_function=embedder)

query =
input
(
"Ask a question: "
)
results = db.similarity_search(query, k=
4
)

context =
"\n\n"
.join([doc.page_content
for
doc
in
results])
prompt =
f"Context:\n
{context}
\n\nAnswer the question:
{query}
"
# Send to Ollama (e.g., using subprocess or Python bindings)
import
subprocess
response = subprocess.run([
"ollama"
,
"run"
,
"mistral"
],
input
=prompt.encode(), capture_output=
True
)
print
(response.stdout.decode())
Notes:
Uses
LangChain + Chroma + Ollama
, no cloud APIs needed
You can add logic to skip previously embedded files by hashing or logging them
Supports any
.txt
content — your
source-control.txt
can also be included
Want me to bundle this as a working repo structure or add Streamlit UI for it?
You said:
I thought it could analyze other types of files as well
ChatGPT said:
Yes — it absolutely can! If you want your explorer to handle
more than just
.txt
files
, you can extend the script to:
Extract text from PDFs, Markdown, Jupyter Notebooks, Python files, LaTeX, etc.
Automatically detect and parse them using LangChain loaders or other tools
File Types You Can Handle
Here are some common file types and how to process them:
File Type
Tool / Loader
Notes
.pdf
PyPDFLoader
,
pdfplumber
Extracts text per page
.md
/
.html
UnstructuredMarkdownLoader
Parses Markdown/HTML
.ipynb
NotebookLoader
Extracts cells
.py
,
.tex
TextLoader
, or custom logic
Raw text
.docx
Docx2txt
,
python-docx
Microsoft Word
.csv
,
.tsv
Pandas / CSVLoader
For structured data
.json
JSONLoader
, custom formatting
Structured nodes
Updated Strategy: Use LangChain's DirectoryLoader
You can use
DirectoryLoader
to load
many file types
at once:
Example: Multi-format Recursive Loader
python
Copy code
from
langchain_community.document_loaders
import
DirectoryLoader, UnstructuredMarkdownLoader, TextLoader, PyPDFLoader
from
langchain.text_splitter
import
RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from
langchain_community.embeddings
import
OllamaEmbeddings
from
langchain_community.vectorstores
import
Chroma

loader = DirectoryLoader(
    path=
"./quadrivium_repo"
,
    glob=
"**/*"
,
# recursive
loader_cls=TextLoader,
# default fallback
loader_kwargs={
"encoding"
:
"utf-8"
},
    silent_errors=
True
)
# You can also use a custom mapping:
custom_loader = DirectoryLoader(
    path=
"./quadrivium_repo"
,
    loaders=[
        (
".md"
, UnstructuredMarkdownLoader),
        (
".pdf"
, PyPDFLoader),
        (
".txt"
, TextLoader),
        (
".py"
, TextLoader),
        (
".ipynb"
, TextLoader),
# could use NotebookLoader for structured handling
],
    silent_errors=
True
,
    recursive=
True
)

docs = custom_loader.load()
# Split & embed
splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=
500
, chunk_overlap=
50
)
chunks = splitter.split_documents(docs)

embedder = OllamaEmbeddings(model=
"nomic-embed-text"
)
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(chunks, embedding=embedder, persist_directory=
"./vector_db"
)
vectorstore.persist()
Want Me to Generate the Full Project for You?
I can scaffold this as a Python package or script set:
Recursive multi-format loader
Embedding pipeline
Local vector DB storage
Natural-language query interface (CLI or Streamlit)
Would you like that starter repo or script bundle?
You said:
Sure
ChatGPT said:
Quadrivium Rag Loader
Your base script for recursively generating and storing embeddings from your
Quadrivium repository
is ready.
It:
Recursively loads
.md
,
.pdf
,
.txt
,
.py
, and
.ipynb
files
Splits documents into manageable chunks
Generates embeddings using Ollama's
nomic-embed-text
Stores them in a persistent local Chroma vector database
Would you like me to now add:
A
CLI or Streamlit app
to query the embeddings?
Optional
metadata logging
for files?
Auto-refresh/reload capability when files change?
Let me know your ideal workflow.
You said:
Give a extremely simplified explanation of what we are doing
ChatGPT said:
Sure! Here's an
extremely simplified explanation
:
We're building a
smart search engine
for your
Quadrivium files
.
Read files
: We go through all your
.txt
,
.md
,
.pdf
,
.py
, etc.
Break them into chunks
: Big files are split into smaller readable parts.
Turn chunks into numbers
: Each chunk is converted into a list of numbers called an
embedding
— like a brainprint of meaning.
Save these brainprints
: We store them in a searchable memory (a "vector database").
Later
: You can
ask questions
, and it will find the most relevant chunks, like a supercharged index.
It's like teaching a digital assistant what's in your folder, so you can
ask it questions instead of digging through files
.
You said:
Ok the base directory will be the current directory
ChatGPT said:
Edited
Great — it's now set to use the
current directory
as the base directory, so you can drop the script right into your project folder and run it directly.
Let me know if you'd like to add querying capabilities or auto-refresh!
You said:
can i make sure it is giving feedback to the terminal which documents it is processing?

This version:
Walks through all subdirectories.
Matches files by extension.
Uses the correct loader per file type.
Prints each loaded file to the terminal.
Let me know if you want to log errors or summaries to a file too.
You said:
ok I have no idea if it's working it could take a long time there are lot of files, it is still loading files.
ChatGPT said:
If it's still printing "Loaded: ..." lines for each file, that means it's working—just slowly.
Here are a few
simple ways to make it clearer and more manageable
while it runs:
✅ Add a file counter to track progress
Insert this after the loop begins:
python
Copy code
file_count =
0
Then update inside the file-loading loop:
python
Copy code
file_count +=
1
print
(
f"[
{file_count}
] Loaded:
{filepath}
")
✅ Limit file types or directories temporarily
If you want to
test faster
, comment out some extensions:
python
Copy code
EXTENSION_LOADERS = {
".md"
: UnstructuredMarkdownLoader,
# ".txt": TextLoader,
# ".py": TextLoader,
# ".ipynb": TextLoader,
# ".pdf": PyPDFLoader,
}
Or skip specific folders:
python
Copy code
if
"node_modules"
in
root
or
".git"
in
root:
continue
✅ Show a summary at the end
Add this at the end of the loading block:
python
Copy code
print
(
f"Done loading
{file_count}
files.")
✅ Optional: estimate time per 100 files
Wrap a timer around loading:
python
Copy code
import
time
start = time.time()
# (loading loop...)
elapsed = time.time() - start
print
(
f"Loaded
{file_count}
files in
{elapsed:
.2
f} seconds.")
Would you like to:
Add a progress bar?
Save the loaded file list to a log file?
Parallelize file reading (for a big speed boost)?
Let me know how you'd like to proceed.
You said:
no i don't want to change anything, i am going to let it keep running. I just don't know if it's going to fill up the memory and crash
ChatGPT said:
Understood — if you're letting it run as-is, here's what you should know:
🔍 What it's doing now
Loading all matching files into memory
as
Document
objects.
Each file's contents, plus metadata, stays in RAM until chunking and embedding.
If you have
hundreds or thousands of large files
,
RAM usage can balloon
— especially with PDFs or notebooks.
🧠 Memory checkpoints
You can watch memory usage with this command in a separate terminal:
bash
Copy code
watch -n 1 free -h
Or use:
bash
Copy code
htop
Look for the Python process and its growing memory.
🧯 What will happen if memory runs out?
Python will crash with a
MemoryError
.
No progress will be saved unless it reaches the
vectorstore.persist()
line.
💡 Mitigation strategy (non-invasive):
If you want to
avoid wasting progress
, you can add a manual save halfway:
python
Copy code
# After splitting chunks, before embedding:
print
(
"Saving halfway checkpoint..."
)
with
open
(
"checkpoint.txt"
,
"w"
)
as
f:
for
doc
in
documents:
        f.write(doc.metadata.get(
"source"
,
"unknown"
) +
"\n"
)
Or break it into a batch system later.
Let me know if you'd like a minimal memory-safe version later — but for now, it's okay to let it run. Just keep an eye on RAM if your system has <16 GB.

ChatGPT said:
That's a
very healthy memory profile
— here's the breakdown:
🔍 Current Status:
Total RAM
: ~15 GB
Used
: ~4.0 GB
Free
: ~10 GB
Available
: ~11 GB (includes cache that can be reclaimed)
Swap Used
: 0 B — excellent! No disk-thrashing from memory overflow.
✅ What This Means:
Your script is running
well within safe limits
.
You have
lots of headroom
(10-11 GB free/available) before any risk of memory exhaustion.
No swap usage = no slowdowns.
Unless you're about to process
tens of thousands of large documents
, you're in the clear.
Just let it keep going — you'll know it's finished when it says:
pgsql
Copy code
Split
into
X chunks.
Embeddings

and
stored.
Let me know if you want it to beep or notify you at the end.
You said:
ok there might be a problem still: 
1617 directories, 64821 files
ChatGPT said:
With
64,821 files
and
1,617 directories
, that
does
raise some legitimate concerns. Let's break it down:
🧠 What Could Go Wrong
Memory overload
during
loader.load()
:
Each file creates a
Document
object.
PDF and notebook parsing is especially memory-intensive.
You could hit a limit depending on file sizes and system overhead.
Embedding bottleneck
:
All text chunks are held in memory before passing to
OllamaEmbeddings
.
That stage may be slower or hit batching limits, depending on model and implementation.
Storage load
:
Chroma vector DB will grow significantly.
Thousands of embedding vectors will be saved in
./vector_db
.
✅ You're Still Okay
If
:
Most files are
short
.txt
,
.md
, or
.py
.
PDFs are minimal or small in size.
Your disk has
>10GB free
(check with
df -h
).
🛡️ Safer Plan (if it crashes):
If it fails or you want a
more controlled approach
, you can refactor like this:
Load and embed files
in batches
(e.g., 100 at a time).
Track processed files in a log (
processed.log
).
Resume from the log if interrupted.
Would you like me to help convert your current script to a
batch + checkpointed
version in case this run fails? It'll look similar to your earlier Bash script logic — but stay entirely in Python.
You said:
I'll think about it, i see now I could have probably ignored pdfs since most have already converted txt versions. There's no harm in seeing if this script works in generating the embeddings, even if it takes quite a few hours. although my computer crashes quite often as it's older
ChatGPT said:
That's a totally reasonable approach — letting the current run continue makes sense
as long as the system stays stable
and memory usage doesn't balloon.
🔍 What You've Got Going for You:
Memory is holding up well.
No swap usage
so far.
You've already built a habit of careful logging and incremental processing (e.g., in your Bash scripts), so even if this run fails, you won't have lost much context.
🧱 If It Does Crash:
No big loss — you'll at least know what the upper limit looks like.
We can then:
Disable
.pdf
handling to reduce processing time/memory.
Enable batching + checkpointed processing (very easy to add).
Possibly preload or pre-split files with
split_documents()
outside the full load cycle.
🧪 If You Want to Monitor Load in Real-Time:
You could open a second terminal and run something like:
bash
Copy code
watch -n 2
"ps -o pid,comm,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%mem | head"
This will show you which processes (probably Python) are using the most memory and CPU — updated every 2 seconds.
Keep me posted — and if it finishes successfully, we can move straight to
building your explorer interface over the vector DB.

ChatGPT said:
Those repeated messages —
Ignoring wrong pointing object #### 0 (offset 0)
—
aren't coming from your
.txt
files
. They're
coming from a PDF parser
, likely
PyMuPDF
(used under the hood by
PyPDFLoader
).
🧠 What's Happening:
This message means the PDF contains internal references to objects that don't exist or are malformed. It's a
harmless warning
in small doses, but:
If you're seeing
hundreds or thousands
of these, it means
a lot of PDFs are being parsed
, and many are damaged or noisy.
This can
slow down or stall
the loader, even if it's still technically running.
✅ Quick Diagnosis:
If it's been a while and you're
not seeing new terminal prints
like:
swift
Copy code
Loaded
:
./
some
/subdirectory/
file.txt
Then the loader might be churning on PDFs and
not making forward progress
.
🩹 Suggested Fix (non-destructive):
Since you already have
.txt
versions, just
temporarily disable PDF parsing
in your code to confirm things work.
✅ Change this line:
python
Copy code
loaders=[
        (
".md"
, UnstructuredMarkdownLoader),
        (
".pdf"
, PyPDFLoader),
        (
".txt"
, TextLoader),
        (
".py"
, TextLoader),
        (
".ipynb"
, TextLoader),
    ],
🚫 To this:
python
Copy code
loaders=[
        (
".md"
, UnstructuredMarkdownLoader),
# (".pdf", PyPDFLoader),  # Temporarily disabled
(
".txt"
, TextLoader),
        (
".py"
, TextLoader),
        (
".ipynb"
, TextLoader),
    ],
Then re-run the script. You should
immediately start seeing progress again
if the issue was with the PDFs.
If you later want to process PDFs safely, we can:
Use a
timeout or retry wrapper
.
Filter by size or known-good paths.
Log only valid PDFs to a list for separate processing.
Let me know if you want help building a PDF-specific pass or repairing the vector store!

ChatGPT said:
Great — that confirms your script
is still working
and making progress! Here's what this means:
✅ Interpreting the Output:
✅
Loaded: ...
lines → These show the loader is
successfully parsing documents
.
⚠️
Ignoring wrong pointing object ...
→ These are
PDF parser warnings
,
not errors
. They appear when
PyMuPDF
(via
PyPDFLoader
) hits malformed cross-references in a PDF. The loader
skips the broken references
and keeps going.
✅ Seeing
.txt
and
.pdf
files both being loaded means your mixed loader strategy is active.
🧠 Should You Be Worried?
Not really
, unless:
The PDF warnings start
flooding the terminal
non-stop.
You notice
no new documents are being printed
for 10+ minutes.
Your memory or CPU usage spikes and stays pegged.
From your previous
free -h
output, you had
lots of RAM and swap left
, so you're fine for now.
💡 Optional Tweaks Later:
If you're concerned about stability or just want to optimize:
Temporarily remove
.pdf
if speed is more important than completeness.
Filter out
.pdf
files over a certain size or from certain subdirectories
.
Split processing into batches
by file type or directory (e.g., one run for
.txt
, one for
.pdf
).
You're in good shape. Let it run for a while — just check the terminal now and then to see if it's still logging new
Loaded: ...
lines. Want a quick command to monitor how many have been loaded so far?
You said:
is there a command I could run to check?
ChatGPT said:
Yep! Since your script prints lines like:
vbnet
Copy code
Loaded:
/path/
to
/file
You can
monitor progress live
by counting those lines in your output log or console.
If you have the output saved in a log file (say
output.log
):
Run this command to count how many files have been loaded so far:
bash
Copy code
grep
"^Loaded:"
output.log |
wc
-l
If you're running the script interactively and want to watch the count as it grows:
You can
tail
the log and count matches continuously:
bash
Copy code
tail
-f output.log | grep --line-buffered
"^Loaded:"
|
wc
-l
(Note: This counts lines continuously but just outputs a running total once, so you might prefer simpler tail + grep)
If you don't have a log file but the script is running in your current terminal:
You can
search your terminal scrollback
for lines starting with
Loaded:
and count them manually or copy them to a file and run the
grep | wc -l
on it.
Bonus: Make your script append to a log file
If you want to log output to a file for easier monitoring, run your script like this:
bash
Copy code
python get-embeddings.py |
tee
embedding_run.log
Then use the commands above on
embedding_run.log
.
Would you like me to help you add logging to your script or a small helper script to report progress?
You said:
i am using byobu If you don't have a log file but the script is running in your current terminal:
You can search your terminal scrollback for lines starting with Loaded: and count them manually or copy them to a file and run the grep | wc -l on it.
ChatGPT said:
Using Byobu is great because it lets you scroll through your terminal buffer easily!
Here's what you can do right now:
Scroll up
in your Byobu window to find the
Loaded:
lines.
You can
copy all those lines
that start with
Loaded:
into a temporary file.
Example:
Enter scrollback mode (usually by pressing
Shift+PageUp
or
Ctrl+a
then
[
in Byobu).
Navigate to the earliest
Loaded:
line you want to count.
Use your mouse or keyboard to
select and copy all the lines
that begin with
Loaded:
.
Then paste them into a file, e.g.,
loaded_files.txt
.
Run:
bash
Copy code
grep
"^Loaded:"
loaded_files.txt |
wc
-l
This will give you the total count of files loaded so far in that copied section.
Quick tip:
If you want to avoid this manual copy-paste next time, you can
run your script with output logged to a file
using:
bash
Copy code
python get-embeddings.py |
tee
embeddings.log
Then you can just
grep
and count from
embeddings.log
anytime.
If you want, I can help you set that up or even write a small shell snippet to periodically count the loaded lines as the log grows.
You said:
I loaded them into a file and removed all lines not starting with Loaded using vim and it left 18,011 lines
ChatGPT said:
Awesome, that means your script has
successfully loaded about 18,000 documents so far!
🎉
Given the number of files you mentioned earlier (~64k), you're roughly a bit less than a third through if those "Loaded:" lines correspond to unique files processed.
That's solid progress!
If you want, you can keep tracking progress by periodically repeating this process or, better yet, start logging the output to a file next time and run:
bash
Copy code
grep
"^Loaded:"
embeddings.log |
wc
-l
to get an instant count anytime without manual copying.
If you want help adding better logging or progress reporting to your script so you can monitor this more easily live, just let me know!
You said:
yeah that was total files, i didn't do a list of the file types we are processing so I am unsure of the final number
ChatGPT said:
Makes sense! Since your
Loaded:
lines include all files that successfully got loaded regardless of type, you can get a breakdown by file type like this:
If your file with just
Loaded:
lines is called
loaded_files.txt
, run:
bash
Copy code
cut
-d
':'
-f2 loaded_files.txt | sed
's/ *//g'
| sed
's/.*\.//'
|
sort
|
uniq
-c |
sort
-nr
Explanation:
cut -d':' -f2
extracts the file path after
Loaded:
sed 's/ *//g'
removes spaces
sed 's/.*\.//'
extracts the file extension
sort | uniq -c
counts unique extensions
sort -nr
sorts by descending count
This will output something like:
python-repl
Copy code
10000 txt
5000 pdf
2000 md
...
That way you get an idea how many of each file type are actually processed and loaded.
Want me to help you set up this reporting in your script next time?
You said:
I mean there are other files like .json or .mhtml or .html I am not processing so there wont be 60 thousand files
ChatGPT said:
Got it — you have many files in total (like .json, .mhtml, .html, etc.) that your loader is ignoring, so the actual number of processed files is much less than the full 64k.
Since your loader only handles certain extensions (.txt, .md, .pdf, .py, etc.), you can get a count of
all
files by extension in the repo, then compare that to how many were actually loaded.
For a quick count of all files by extension in your base directory (and subdirectories), try this:
bash
Copy code
find . -
type
f | sed
's/.*\.//'
|
sort
|
uniq
-c |
sort
-nr
This shows you the distribution of file types present.
Then compare that to your loaded files count (from your logs) to estimate the percentage of files actually processed.
If you want to filter your loader's accepted extensions only, you can do:
bash
Copy code
find . -
type
f \( -name
"*.txt"
-o -name
"*.md"
-o -name
"*.pdf"
-o -name
"*.py"
-o -name
"*.ipynb"
\) |
wc
-l
That'll tell you approximately how many files your script
should
be processing.
Would you like me to help you write a script that automatically compares these numbers and reports how many files exist vs how many were loaded?
You said:
[2m 18.876s] flyxion@volsorium:/mnt/c/Users/nateg/OneDrive/Documentos/GitHub/quadrivium$ find . -type f \( -name "*.txt" -o -name "*.md" -o -name "*.pdf" -o -name "*.py" -o -name "*.ipynb" \) | wc -l

44349
ChatGPT said:
Cool, so you have about
44,349 files
with those extensions that your script
could
process.
Since you logged about
18,000 loaded documents
so far, that's roughly
40% processed
if your run covers all files and hasn't finished yet.
If you plan to let it keep running, that ratio gives you a rough idea of progress.
If it seems slow or heavy, you could always skip some file types like PDFs (since you mentioned you already have txt versions) to speed things up and reduce memory.
Want help writing a version of the script that only processes
.txt
,
.md
,
.py
,
.ipynb
and skips
.pdf
?
You said:
I'll just keep letting it process. It might take a lot longer to generate embeddings. I just wanted to know if it was going to take hours or days.
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, with tens of thousands of files, it's definitely going to take hours and potentially stretch into a day or two depending on your hardware, embedding speed, and whether it batches efficiently.
If you see consistent progress logs like
Loaded:
lines every now and then and no crashes or memory spikes, that's a good sign it's working steadily—just slowly.
If it starts stalling or you see repeated errors, then it might need some tweaking or batching improvements.
Meanwhile, you can keep an eye on memory and CPU usage to catch any issues early.
If you want, I can help you think through optimizations later — for example:
Skipping large or slow formats (like PDFs)
Processing only changed/new files incrementally
Adding progress checkpoints or batching
Offloading embedding to a faster machine or cloud
But for now, sounds like you've got a solid start! Just let it run and monitor.
Want me to help you set up a lightweight progress/status reporter in your script next?
You said:
Ok it ran for a few hours but still was loading. I am going to try a subfolder, cognetics, instead.
ChatGPT said:
That's a smart move — testing on a smaller subset like
cognetics
will help you:
Verify functionality
(loading, chunking, embedding, saving)
Estimate performance
(e.g., time per 100 files or per MB)
Catch bugs or bottlenecks
early
Avoid long wait times or crashing your system
To do that, you can modify this line in your script:
python
Copy code
BASE_DIR = os.getcwd()
To something like:
python
Copy code
BASE_DIR = os.path.join(os.getcwd(),
"cognetics"
)
Then re-run the script. You'll get faster feedback and can confirm that embeddings are correctly generated and persisted in the
vector_db
folder.
Once it works well on that subfolder, you can:
Try larger folders incrementally
Add logging timestamps per document
Consider parallelizing or batching for speed
Let me know if you want help automating any of that!
You said:
that's fine I just copied the script to that folder instead
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — that's a totally reasonable way to isolate the test without changing the code. By copying the script into the
cognetics
folder and running it there, you're keeping:
BASE_DIR = os.getcwd()
pointing to just
cognetics
The output (
vector_db
) contained locally
Your original setup untouched
Now you can:
See how long it takes to process a manageable number of files
Verify that
vector_db/
is being populated
Test querying once embeddings are built
Let me know when you're ready to add querying or if you want to benchmark speed per document/chunk.
You said:
ok well I already got farther, there was only like 7000 files in the folder, it broke because i needed to install chromadb , and now                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ChatGPT said:
That error means your script is trying to use
Ollama
to generate embeddings, but the
Ollama server isn't running
on your machine.
Quick Fix:
You need to
start the Ollama server
before running the script. Here's how:
✅ To Start Ollama
If you have Ollama installed:
bash
Copy code
ollama serve
Leave that running in a separate terminal or backgrounded session (like in another
byobu
window).
🧠 Why This Happens
The line in your script using:
python
Copy code
embedder = OllamaEmbeddings(model=
"nomic-embed-text"
)
...relies on a
local Ollama HTTP endpoint
at
http://localhost:11434/api/embeddings
. If that's not running, it crashes with the
Connection refused
error.
🛠 Alternatives
If you don't want to run Ollama (or it's flaky on your system), you could switch to:
HuggingFaceEmbeddings
OpenAIEmbeddings
(if you have an API key)
Local models using SentenceTransformers
(very efficient for CPU/GPU)
I can show you how to make that switch if needed.
Let me know if you'd like:
help starting Ollama
to switch embedding providers
or to catch the error more gracefully in your script
You said:
ValueError: Error raised by inference API HTTP code: 404, {"error":"model \"nomic-embed-text\" not found, try pulling it first"}
C:\> ollama pull nomic-embed-text

ChatGPT said:
Perfect — you're doing exactly the right thing. That error:
vbnet
Copy code
ValueError:
... model
"nomic-embed-text"
not
found,
try
pulling it first
means Ollama is working, but the model it needs (
nomic-embed-text
) just isn't downloaded yet.
You're fixing it by running:
bash
Copy code
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
Once that finishes, you can re-run your script and it should start embedding without crashing.
✅ After the Pull Finishes
Just make sure the Ollama server is still running:
bash
Copy code
ollama serve
If you ran it earlier and closed that terminal, you'll need to restart it. Then rerun your Python script.
Let me know if you want to:
test with a smaller folder before scaling up,
change to a different model,
or log progress more visibly.

/mnt/c/Users/nateg/OneDrive/Documentos/GitHub/quadrivium/cognetics/./get-embeddings.py:50: LangChainDeprecationWarning: The class
OllamaEmbeddings
was deprecated in LangChain 0.3.1 and will be removed in 1.0.0. An updated version of the class exists in the :class:
~langchain-ollama package and should be used instead. To use it run
pip install -U :class:
~langchain-ollama
and import as
from :class:
~langchain_ollama import OllamaEmbeddings`
.
embedder = OllamaEmbeddings(model=EMBED_MODEL)
ChatGPT said:
Nice — you're almost fully up and running!
That message is just a
deprecation warning
, not an error. It means:
"You're using a version of
OllamaEmbeddings
from the older
langchain_community
package. This will be removed eventually, and you should switch to the new
langchain-ollama
package in the future."
You can safely ignore it
for now
, especially if your script is working. But if you want to future-proof the script later, here's how to upgrade properly:
✅ Optional Upgrade (Not urgent)
If you want to switch to the new version:
Install the updated package
:
bash
Copy code
pip install -U langchain-ollama
Change the import line
in your script:
python
Copy code
# Old:
from
langchain_community.embeddings
import
OllamaEmbeddings
# New:
from
langchain_ollama
import
OllamaEmbeddings
The rest of your script should work the same way.
But again — no need to do this right now. If you're seeing:
csharp
Copy code
Split
into
340068
chunks.
That means the loader and splitter worked! You're now entering the
embedding
phase, which will take some time — but it's doing what you asked.
You said:
ok, this is the command I ran:  pip3 install langchain-ollama --break-system-packages
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — running:
bash
Copy code
pip3 install langchain-ollama --break-system-packages
does exactly what you need to start using the newer
OllamaEmbeddings
class from the updated
langchain-ollama
package. The
--break-system-packages
flag just tells
pip
to go ahead even if it needs to modify a protected system-wide Python installation (e.g. on Debian-based distros like Ubuntu). It's a bit aggressive, but totally fine if you're managing your own environment and not using system Python for critical system tasks.
✅ Next Steps: Update Your Import
Now that you've installed the new package, update your script's import:
🔧 In
get-embeddings.py
:
python
Copy code
# Replace this line:
from
langchain_community.embeddings
import
OllamaEmbeddings
# With this:
from
langchain_ollama
import
OllamaEmbeddings
That change will suppress the deprecation warning and future-proof your embedding logic.
You're all set to continue generating your vector database! Let me know if you want to streamline chunk size, parallelize embedding, or prune junk files.
You said:
so what happened did they move it from a community developed section to the main code or something?
ChatGPT said:
Exactly — here's a simple breakdown of what happened:
📦 What changed?
Old location
:
OllamaEmbeddings
used to live in
langchain_community.embeddings
, meaning it was maintained as part of LangChain's
community-contributed integrations
.
New location
(from v0.3.1 onward):
It's now in a dedicated external package called
langchain-ollama
, meaning it's maintained separately from the core and community modules, but
officially supported
.
🧠 Why they did this
LangChain is moving toward a
modular plugin architecture
, where each external integration (like Ollama, Chroma, Pinecone, etc.) gets its own separate package. This helps:
Reduce bloat in the core LangChain install.
Allow faster iteration and fixes for specific integrations without waiting for full LangChain updates.
Make dependency management cleaner and avoid breaking unrelated tools.
🔧 Summary of action items
If you see something move like this:
Old Import
New Import
Install Command
langchain_community.embeddings.OllamaEmbeddings
langchain_ollama.OllamaEmbeddings
pip install langchain-ollama
This is happening across multiple integrations, not just Ollama.
Let me know if you want help checking for other upcoming deprecations or modularizing the rest of your script!
You said:
it still seems to be embedding. any commands to see how it's working?
ChatGPT said:
Great — if it's still running and embedding, here are a few
ways you can check on its progress and system impact
while it works:
✅ 1.
See real-time disk writes (embedding → vector store)
Check if it's writing to the
./vector_db/
directory (Chroma's persisted DB):
bash
Copy code
watch -n 2
du
-sh ./vector_db
This will update every 2 seconds and show how much data has been written. If it's growing steadily, embeddings are being generated and stored.
✅ 2.
Monitor CPU usage (embedding = compute-heavy)
To see if the process is actively using CPU:
bash
Copy code
htop
Look for a Python or
ollama
process with high CPU usage. You can also use:
bash
Copy code
top -p $(pgrep -f get-embeddings.py |
head
-n1)
✅ 3.
Check Ollama's model activity
If
ollama
is running locally, you can check which model is active with:
bash
Copy code
ollama list
You can also inspect active logs (if logging is on) or use:
bash
Copy code
ps aux | grep ollama
✅ 4.
Tail the vector store files for evidence of writes
Try this if you want low-level confirmation:
bash
Copy code
ls
-lt ./vector_db/chroma/
# Or wherever your vector DB lives
You should see timestamps updating as embedding progresses.
✅ 5.
(Advanced) Count chunks processed so far
If you modify your script to print or log progress every N chunks, it would be ideal. But short of that, you could run something like:
bash
Copy code
lsof | grep vector_db | grep -i write
To list any open write files in the vector database directory.
Optional: Add Progress Bar (future improvement)
If you're going to be doing this often, it's easy to wrap your embedding loop with
tqdm
:
python
Copy code
from
tqdm
import
tqdm
...
# Create embeddings with progress bar
for
chunk
in
tqdm(chunks):
    vectorstore.add_documents([chunk])
Let me know if you want help integrating that!
Would you like a version of your current script with a tqdm progress bar added?
You said:

ChatGPT said:
Thanks — your system usage confirms a few important things:
The
get-embeddings.py
process
is alive
and consuming CPU and memory (
13% CPU
,
~1GB RAM
).
Disk writes aren't happening yet
, meaning it's still in the
embedding stage
, likely preparing vectors in memory.
Chroma's
.persist()
method hasn't been reached yet — this only writes once all embeddings are done.
🔍 What This Means
You're currently in this part of the script:
python
Copy code
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(chunks, embedding=embedder, persist_directory=VECTOR_DIR)
This
processes all embeddings in memory
,
then persists them
in one step at the end. So until that's complete,
./vector_db/
won't change, and disk activity will be minimal.
🧠 Interpretation
Given:
340,068 chunks
is a
very large number
for embedding.
Ollama
is likely batching requests or processing serially.
You're only seeing 13% CPU and moderate RAM usage.
→ Embedding is
active but slow
, probably because Ollama is running locally and the
nomic-embed-text
model is lightweight but not extremely fast.
✅ Next Steps You Can Do Now
1.
Tail Ollama's output (if available)
If Ollama logs to stdout or a file, try:
bash
Copy code
ps aux | grep ollama
Or look for recent logs in:
bash
Copy code
~/.ollama/logs/
2.
Use
strace
to watch activity
You can spy on what the process is doing with:
bash
Copy code
strace -p $(pgrep -f get-embeddings.py)
It will show you whether it's stuck in a loop, waiting for network, etc.
3.
Let it keep running
If you're seeing memory growth and the process isn't crashing or thrashing swap, it's probably fine. Expect it to take
hours
, maybe
half a day or more
.
💡 For Future Optimization
If you'd like:
A way to
embed and persist incrementally
,
A
batch progress bar
(via
tqdm
),
Or use
faster models
, like
sentence-transformers

This
strace
output is
very encouraging
— it confirms that:
✅ Your script
is actively sending embedding requests
to Ollama's local server (
127.0.0.1:11434
).
✅ The connection is
alive
, and data is being
sent via HTTP POST
to
/api/embeddings
.
✅ It is waiting for a
response (
recvfrom
)
, meaning the Ollama model is likely crunching embeddings.
🔁 What This Means
You're not stuck — you're in the
embedding loop
. For
340,068 chunks
, this could take
several hours to even a full day
, depending on:
CPU speed,
Ollama's model performance (
nomic-embed-text
is lightweight but still not instant),
Whether requests are done
serially
(which is likely here).
🔧 Optional Enhancements (Highly Recommended)
Let me know if you want any of these improvements:
Live Progress Tracking
Add a
tqdm
progress bar for each document or chunk embedded.
Batch Embedding with Periodic Save
Modify the script to save to disk every N files (avoids data loss if you crash).
Parallel Embedding
Use asynchronous requests to Ollama, speeding things up dramatically (if the model supports it).
Filter Already Embedded Files
If re-running, skip files with existing vector entries.
Would you like a modified version of your script with one or more of these enhancements?
You said:
there is now a folder called vector_db, it's about 2 gigabytes.

How can I create a script that querries it?
ChatGPT said:
Great! If you have a
vector_db

ChromaDB
(the default persistent vector store in LangChain and many embedding workflows).
You can now write a simple Python script to
query that database
using natural language. Here's a clean example:

🔍 Sample Questions in More Detail
You can tailor the above to match your own domain or writing. Here's what each question is probing for:
"What is cognetics and how is it different from traditional cognitive science?"
→ Synthesizes the philosophical or theoretical shift you're exploring.
"Summarize the role of feedback loops in human-computer interaction."
→ Likely appears in design/HCI/cybernetics material.
"What are some key ideas from Donald Norman mentioned in the documents?"
→ For any UX or human-centered design texts embedded.
"How does the concept of affordance relate to design and perception?"
→ Brings up grounded cognitive theory and design interface metaphors.
Would you like it to

ChatGPT said:
Yup — that error means LangChain tried to use the
mistral
model with Ollama, but it wasn't pulled yet.
You're already doing the right thing:
nginx
Copy code
ollama
pull mistral
That'll download the model (~4.1 GB), and once it's finished, your query script should work immediately.
🔁 Recap of What's Happening
LangChain → Ollama →
mistral
You're using
Ollama(model="mistral")
, so it calls Ollama's local API at
http://localhost:11434/api/generate
.
But since
mistral
wasn't downloaded, you got:
vbnet
Copy code
OllamaEndpointNotFoundError:
... Maybe your model
is
not
found
and
you should pull the model
with
`ollama pull mistral`.
✅ After It Finishes Pulling
Once the pull completes:
You can re-run the
query_vector_db_with_sources.py
script.
It should now embed your query, search the vector DB, and generate a response using the Mistral model locally.
Let me know if you'd like to:
Switch models (e.g.
llama3

phi3
, etc.)

or
.jsonl
file for inspection

ChatGPT said:
That warning is letting you know that the
get_relevant_documents()
method is deprecated in recent versions of LangChain. It
still works
, but they're moving toward a new, cleaner
.invoke()
API to standardize how you call things like retrievers, chains, and tools.
✅ You Don't
Have
to Change It Yet
Your script will continue working for now, but it's good practice to future-proof.
🔁 Fix: Replace
get_relevant_documents(query)
with
retriever.invoke(query)
Here's how you can update the code safely:
Before:
python
Copy code
docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)
After:
python
Copy code
docs = retriever.invoke(query)
📌 Why the Change?
LangChain is moving toward a
unified invocation pattern
. Instead of having every component use slightly different methods (
.run()
,
.call()
,
.get_relevant_documents()
, etc.), they're standardizing on
.invoke()
and

for everything.
This also lets you do:
python
Copy code
response = some_chain.invoke(

)
Or even:
python
Copy code
async
for
token
in
some_llm.astream(query):
print

🤖 Answer:
  Cognetics is not explicitly defined in the provided content, but it appears to be a field of study that focuses on magnetism and electricity, differentiating from traditional cognitive science, which typically deals with mind and intelligence. This interpretation is based on the context clues from the text files, including mentions of magnetism, electricity, magnetic fields, and moving electric charges.

But the big picture of magnetism is very different, because the big picture of magnetism is this.
What magnetism is really about, and I'm going to say it big and I'm going to say it loud,
magnetism is about moving electric charge.
Magnetism is about electricity just as much as everything we've done so far in our lectures on electromagnetism,
had been about electricity, because magnetism is fundamentally a phenomenon involving moving electric charge....

[2] Source: /mnt/c/Users/nateg/OneDrive/Documentos/GitHub/quadrivium/cognetics/Physics and our Universe/35. The Origin Of Magnetism.avi.txt
So there are no magnetic monopoles.
So then we have to ask the question, if there aren't sort of isolated magnetic north and
south poles, it would be the analogs of electric charge in giving rise to magnetism.
What is the source of magnetism?
So let me remind you again, say it big and loud and clear, what magnetism is all about.
Magnetism is fundamentally about moving electric charge.
And I said it in the previous lecture, moving electric charge responds to magnetic fields,...

it will align in the same direction as an external field, but will have no net magnetization

In summary, magnetism is the result of moving electric charges at various scales, from macroscopic currents in wires to microscopic currents in atoms. Ferromagnetism allows for the creation of permanent magnets and is the most common type of magnetism we experience. Paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials exhibit weaker forms of magnetism, and electromagnetic induction explains how changing magnetic fields can produce electric currents. Magnetic monopoles remain a theoretical concept as no...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🔍 Your question:
ChatGPT said:
It looks like your query system is
working correctly
, but it's surfacing results that are heavily biased toward
physics lectures
—specifically on magnetism—because that's what your vector DB is currently dominated by in the
cognetics/
directory.
⚠️ Interpretation Error: Cognetics ≠ Magnetism
Your vector retriever is doing its job: it's returning the
most semantically similar documents
to the term "cognetics" based on embeddings. But since the only matches in your DB are lectures discussing
electric charge and magnetism
, the system is interpreting
"Cognetics"
in that context—even though you're likely using the term in a
different conceptual or philosophical
sense.
🧠 What To Do Next
✅ 1.
Improve Contextual Coverage
You need to
add documents
that define "Cognetics" in your intended context—whether that's:
Human-computer interaction (as in Jef Raskin's use),
A neologism combining cognition + energetics,
Or your own theoretical framework.
Just drop a
.txt
file in the source folder containing:
txt
Copy code
Cognetics refers to the study of cognitive processes as dynamic energy-based systems. It differs from traditional cognitive science by emphasizing recursive attention loops, entropy gradients, and magnetic analogies of perception rather than symbolic or representational models...
Then
re-run your vector embedding script
on that new file (or write a delta ingestor for new documents).
✅ 2.
Refine Your Retriever or Query
If you want to avoid irrelevant physics texts when asking philosophical or conceptual questions, try:
python
Copy code
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={
"k"
:
5
,
"filter"
: {
"source"
:
"philosophy"
}})
...but that only works if you've
tagged sources by topic
during embedding, e.g. using metadata like:
python
Copy code
doc.metadata = {
"source"
:
"philosophy"
}
✅ 3.
Upgrade Your Script to Use
.invoke()
To remove warnings:
python
Copy code
docs = retriever.invoke(query)
result = qa_chain.invoke({
"input_documents"
: docs,
"question"
: query})
🔁 Sample Questions to Try Once You Add New Context
Once you've added more balanced sources, try:
What are the core principles of cognetics?
How does cognetics relate to recursive perception?
In what way does cognetics model cognition as an entropic system?
Compare cognetics to traditional symbolic cognitive models.
Would you like help editing the embedding script to include metadata tagging or automatic context classification?
You said:
the name of the folder is cognetics, but it is not mentioned in the archive so it was a fine question. What are contained are teaching company courses on physics, astronomy, history, psychology, math and so on. However I would prefer to be using granite3.2:8b over mistral.
ChatGPT said:
Got it — thank you for the clarification.
You have a
cognetics/
folder that's a
thematic archive
of Teaching Company / Great Courses materials across
physics, astronomy, history, psychology, math
, etc. — not specifically about "Cognetics" as a defined term. So the model wasn't wrong to reach for physics when asked what "cognetics" is, but you understandably want
more intelligent disambiguation
or broader semantic synthesis.
Also, you're switching from
mistral
to
granite-3b-8b
(presumably
granite-3b-8b
or
granite-3b-chat
or
granite-8b-chat
, depending on what you have pulled). Let's make that transition.
✅ Step-by-Step: Use
granite
Instead of
mistral
in LangChain with Ollama
1.
Pull the model (if not already):
bash
Copy code
ollama pull granite:8b
# or
ollama pull granite3b:8b
2.
Update the Ollama model in your script:
Wherever you currently have:
python
Copy code
llm = Ollama(model=
"mistral"
)
Change it to:
python
Copy code
llm = Ollama(model=
"granite:8b"
)
# or "granite3b:8b" depending on the tag you pulled
You can check which models are installed with:
bash
Copy code
ollama list
And test a direct call to confirm it's working:
bash
Copy code
ollama run granite:8b
🧠 Optional Improvements
🔁 Update deprecated LangChain calls
To silence warnings and future-proof your code:
python
Copy code
# OLD (deprecated)
docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)
result = qa_chain({
"input_documents"
: docs,
"question"
: query}, return_only_outputs=
True
)
# NEW (current)
docs = retriever.invoke(query)
result = qa_chain.invoke({
"input_documents"
: docs,
"question"
: query})
🧪 Sample Questions That Fit Your Archive
Given the general educational content, try questions like:
How did magnetism emerge as a concept in classical physics?
What distinguishes Newtonian from Einsteinian gravity in astronomical models?
What are the historical roots of modern psychology as presented in academic courses?
How do mathematics and logic underlie physical laws in contemporary physics education?
These will help the retriever surface
meaningful course-based insights
, especially when you switch to a stronger LLM like Granite.
Would you like me to rewrite the full

how can I run it while generating an output copy to ouput.txt ./query-vectors.py
ChatGPT said:
To run your Python script (
query-vectors.py
) and
simultaneously save its output to a file
(
output.txt
) while still displaying it in the terminal, use the
tee
command.
✅ Option 1: Linux/macOS/WSL (which you're using, based on
/mnt/c/...
path)
bash
Copy code
python3 ./query-vectors.py |
tee
output.txt
tee
duplicates stdout: it prints to the screen
and
writes to
output.txt
.
If you want to
overwrite
output.txt
each time:
✅ use as shown.
If you want to
append
instead:
bash
Copy code
python3 ./query-vectors.py |
tee
-a output.txt
✅ Option 2: Windows (CMD or PowerShell)
If you're running from
CMD
, use:
cmd
Copy code
python query-vectors.py > output.txt
type output.txt
If you want
real-time output
, PowerShell does better:
powershell
Copy code
python .\query-vectors.py | Tee-Object -FilePath output.txt
💡 Tip for Better Logs
If your script prints long answers, and you want
timestamps
or separators in
output.txt
, you can wrap the script or pipe the output through something like
awk
,
sed
, or a logging wrapper. Let me know if you want help with that.
Want to auto-open
output.txt
after the script runs? Or log errors (
stderr
) too? Just ask.
You said:
ok it's not practical granite takes too long to load maybe and the mistral one was working
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, that makes total sense—models like
granite3.2:8b
can be pretty heavyweight and take a while to spin up, especially locally. If
mistral
is already working smoothly and responds faster, it's usually better for iterative testing and quick queries.
You can always switch back to mistral in your code with:
python
Copy code
llm = OllamaLLM(model=
"mistral"
)
If you want, I can help you optimize the usage or do lightweight batching, so you get the most out of mistral without waiting too long.
Want me to show you a quick way to toggle between models in your script?

ChatGPT said:
Thanks for sharing the full script! It looks solid overall, very similar to your working old one, just with new questions — so the logic should be fine.
If the new script doesn't seem to be working at all, here are a few debugging tips and suggestions:
1.
Check for Deprecation Warnings / API Changes
You had earlier deprecation warnings for:
OllamaEmbeddings
(moved to
langchain_ollama
package)
Chroma
(moved to
langchain_chroma
package)
Ollama
(moved to
langchain_ollama
package)
If you haven't updated your imports or installed those newer packages, the script might silently fail or hang.
Try updating your imports to the newer recommended ones:
python
Copy code
# After `pip install -U langchain-ollama langchain-chroma`
from
langchain_ollama
import
OllamaEmbeddings, OllamaLLM
from
langchain_chroma
import
Chroma
And then:
python
Copy code
embedding = OllamaEmbeddings(model=EMBED_MODEL)
vectorstore = Chroma(persist_directory=PERSIST_DIRECTORY, embedding_function=embedding)
llm = OllamaLLM(model=LLM_MODEL)
2.
Check if your
vector_db
folder is intact and accessible
Make sure the vector database files are present and not corrupted. If the vectorstore cannot load the data,
retriever.get_relevant_documents()
may return an empty list, making the QA chain produce no output.
3.
Add some debug prints
Try adding prints to confirm the retriever is returning documents, e.g.:
python
Copy code
docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)
print
(
f"Retrieved
{
len
(docs)} documents.")
if
not
docs:
print
(
"No documents found, try a different query or check your vector store."
)
4.
Check your versions
Run:
bash
Copy code
pip list | grep langchain
pip list | grep ollama
pip list | grep chroma
Make sure you are using compatible versions as per the LangChain docs.
5.
Minimal working example
Try a minimal example just to check the retrieval:
python
Copy code
query =
"What is cognetics?"
docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)
print
(
f"Docs retrieved:
{
len
(docs)}")
for
doc
in
docs:
print
(doc.page_content[:
200
])
If that works, the problem might be in the chain setup or the LLM call.
6.
Use
.invoke()
instead of deprecated
.get_relevant_documents()
and
.call()
LangChain's new API prefers
.invoke()
:
python
Copy code
docs = retriever.invoke(query)
result = qa_chain.invoke({
"input_documents"
: docs,
"question"
: query})
7.
Sample fixed snippet with
.invoke()
python
Copy code
while
True
:
    query =
input
(
"🔍 Your question: "
)
if
query.lower()
in
(
"exit"
,
"quit"
):
break
docs = retriever.invoke(query)
print
(
f"Retrieved
{
len
(docs)} docs")
if
not
docs:
print
(
"No docs found, try a different query."
)
continue
result = qa_chain.invoke({
"input_documents"
: docs,
"question"
: query})
print
(
"\n🤖 Answer:\n"
, result[
"output_text"
])

🔍 Your question:  What are the basic principles of magnetism in physics?
Retrieved 4 documents.

🤖 Answer:
  The basic principles of magnetism in physics include:

1. Electromagnetism: Magnetism is a result of the movement of electric charges. This relationship between electricity and magnetism is described by Maxwell's equations.

2. Magnetic Field: A magnetic field is a region around a magnet or moving electric charge where its force can be detected. It is typically represented by B (for magnetic flux density).

3. Right-Hand Rule: The right-hand rule is a way to determine the direction of the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying wire. If you extend your thumb, index finger, and middle finger of your right hand so that they are mutually perpendicular, wrapping the wire around the thumb represents the direction of the current, and the direction of the magnetic field is from the index finger to the middle finger.

4. Magnetic Domains: In ferromagnetic materials, atoms align themselves into small regions called domains. When a magnet is made or demagnetized, it is by aligning these domains in a single direction.

5. Magnetic Field Lines: Magnetic field lines are imaginary lines drawn to represent the magnetic field. The direction of the magnetic field at any point is tangent to the field line at that point.

6. Ampere's Law: Ampere's law describes how a magnetic field can be generated by an electric current, and it is one of Maxwell's equations.

7. Gauss' Law for Magnetism: Gauss' law for magnetism states that the total magnetic flux through any closed surface is always zero if there are no magnetic charges (monopoles) enclosed by the surface. This law helps explain why there are no isolated north or south poles in ferromagnets.

8. Ferromagnetism: Ferromagnetism is the type of magnetism that occurs in certain materials, such as iron, nickel, and cobalt, at temperatures below their Curie points. In these materials, atomic magnetic domains align themselves to create a net macroscopic magnetic moment.

9. Diamagnetism: Diamagnetism is the weak magnetic response exhibited by most substances when they are placed in an external magnetic field. It is due to the induced currents in the material caused by the magnetic field.

10. Paramagnetism: Paramagnetism is a type of magnetism that occurs in certain substances, such as oxygen and aluminum, where the atoms have unpaired electrons. In an external magnetic field, these electrons align themselves parallel to the field, creating a weak magnetic moment.

These principles provide the foundation for understanding various aspects of magnetism, including the behavior of magnets, the interaction between electric currents and magnetic fields, and the properties of ferromagnetic, diamagnetic, and paramagnetic materials.

Question:  What are the basic principles of magnetism in physics?

Answer:
1. The fundamental principle of magnetism is that it arises from moving electric charges. This principle allows us to understand and harness magnetic fields for practical applications like electric motors.
2. Ferromagnetism is the most common type of magnetism we experience, with ferromagnets exhibiting permanent magnets. Paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials exhibit weaker forms of magnetism.
3. Electromagnetic induction explains how changing magnetic fields can produce electric currents.
4. Magnetic monopoles remain a theoretical concept as no experimental evidence has been found to support their existence.

6. **Fundamental Principle**: The key takeaway from this discussion on magnetism is that it's about moving electric charge and the forces associated with that motion. Understanding this principle allows us to harness magnetic fields for practical applications, such as in electric motors....

In summary, magnetism is the result of moving electric charges at various scales, from macroscopic currents in wires to microscopic currents in atoms. Ferromagnetism allows for the creation of permanent magnets and is the most common type of magnetism we experience. Paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials exhibit weaker forms of magnetism, and electromagnetic induction explains how changing magnetic fields can produce electric currents. Magnetic monopoles remain a theoretical concept as no...

So let's summarize what we know in this first lecture on magnetism. The big idea, the thing you should remember 10 years out from this course if you've forgotten everything else is that magnetism is really about moving electric charge. The magnetic force on a moving charge depends on the charge. It depends on the magnetic field strength and it depends on the charge's velocity by this complicated geometrical relationship that we can sum up...

But the big picture of magnetism is very different, because the big picture of magnetism is this. What magnetism is really about, and I'm going to say it big and I'm going to say it loud, magnetism is about moving electric charge. Magnetism is about electricity just as much as everything we've done so far in our lectures on electromagnetism, had been about electricity, because magnetism is fundamentally a phenomenon involving moving electric charge....

Question: How did Newton and Einstein differ in their ideas of gravity?

Answer:
 Newton and Einstein differed in their ideas about gravity. While Newton saw gravity as a force acting between two masses, Einstein proposed that gravity is a result of the curvature of space-time caused by mass and energy. In Einstein's theory, space-time itself is affected by the presence of matter, which causes it to curve and affect the motion of objects within it. In contrast, Newton was unable to explain how gravity worked or where it came from, leading some critics to accuse him of introducing magic into his science.

And Newton was always worried about the idea of gravity as a force because it seemed somewhat arbitrary. In fact, some of his rivals accused him of introducing a sort of something magical into his science because he had no idea how to explain it. Einstein came up with a very elegant explanation which suggested that space-time itself is shaped in different ways. And it's that shaping that affects how things move through it. So gravity is a function of space-time. But I'm not a physicist....

Question: What is the role of historical causality in teaching company history courses?

Answer:
 Historical causality plays a significant role in teaching company history courses by helping students understand the relationships between events and their effects. Causal inferences are used to identify and explain these relationships, often providing a narrative account of events. The concept of causation has different meanings, and causal warrants are used for various purposes. Determining causality involves a variety of methods, often using an inductive approach that requires the inference to satisfy several tests. In teaching company history, understanding historical causality can help students grasp how events shaped the development and growth of companies over time.

Question: How is statistical inference presented in the math lectures?

Answer:
 Statistical inference is presented as a way to infer characteristics of a whole population from a sample, based on the concepts of probability and randomness. It is closely related to understanding cause and effect and is introduced in lectures eight through 12, following lectures four through seven which focus on describing data. In lecture eight, probability for inference is presented as the main concept.

Question: Explain Bayesian reasoning.

Answer:
 Bayesian reasoning is a method for making decisions and updating beliefs in the presence of uncertainty by using Bayes' theorem, which updates our beliefs based on new evidence. It combines the prior probability of an event or hypothesis with the likelihood of that event given the observed data to calculate the posterior probability, which represents our updated belief after incorporating the new information. In essence, Bayesian reasoning allows us to make more informed decisions by considering both our initial beliefs and new evidence.

[2] Source: /mnt/c/Users/nateg/OneDrive/Documentos/GitHub/quadrivium/cognetics/Philosophy of Science/overview.txt
To address the Raven paradox, we can turn to Bayesianism, a statistical approach to reasoning under uncertainty that updates our beliefs in light of new evidence using Bayes' theorem. According to Bayesianism, the probability of a hypothesis given the evidence (posterior probability) is proportional to the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (likelihood) multiplied by the prior probability of the hypothesis....

Question: What's an autocatalytic set?

Answer:
 An autocatalytic set is a system where one or more components of the system promote their own production, creating a positive feedback loop that can lead to exponential growth. This concept is often used in chemistry and biology to describe self-replicating systems. However, it's important to note that an autocatalytic set may not be testable due to the complexity of the system and the difficulty in monitoring all the chemical species involved.

Question: Explain vacuum energy expansion.

Answer:
 Vacuum energy expansion refers to the property of empty space that contains energy due to quantum fluctuations. This energy has a repulsive effect which counteracts gravitational attraction and causes an accelerated expansion of the universe, resulting in its current observed acceleration. This energy is also hypothesized to be the same as dark energy, which makes up approximately 68% of the total energy content of the observable universe. The energy density stays constant as space expands, but since there's more volume, the energy increases, making the expansion faster over time.

vacuum expands, if there gets to be more vacuum, the energy density stays the same, but there's now more volume, and so there's actually more energy. And so the energy does not go down with expansion, but rather goes up. And by the analogy in this picture, that's the opposite of what happens with an ordinary gas with positive pressure.

An
autocatalytic set
is a system in which some components catalyze or promote the production of other components within the same system, effectively supporting and sustaining their own existence through a network of mutual catalysis. This creates a positive feedback loop that can lead to self-sustaining and often exponential growth of the set. Autocatalytic sets are important in chemistry and biology as models of self-replicating and self-organizing systems, such as metabolic networks or the origin of life scenarios.
However, due to the complexity of these systems and the large number of interacting species involved, it can be very difficult or even impossible to experimentally test or monitor the full set of interactions in practice.
Summary:
Components mutually catalyze each other's production.
Results in a positive feedback loop.
Leads to self-sustaining growth.
Important in understanding self-replication and complex chemical networks.
Testing such sets can be challenging due to complexity.

ChatGPT said:
The point of the vector database experiments in the GitHub repository is to explore efficient ways to store, search, and retrieve large collections of unstructured data (like text, images, or embeddings) based on semantic similarity. By using vector databases, you can perform fast nearest-neighbor searches in high-dimensional vector spaces, which is crucial for tasks such as:
Content-based retrieval:
Finding related documents or images by meaning rather than keywords.
Enhanced search capabilities:
Improving search relevance by matching user queries to conceptually similar content.
Annotation and categorization:
Organizing and tagging large datasets by clustering semantically similar items.
Interactive exploration:
Building interfaces that let users browse and rate content efficiently by leveraging similarity metrics.
In this repository, these experiments aim to test how vector databases can support workflows like image rating, semantic tagging, and multi-modal data exploration — essentially making large datasets easier to analyze, navigate, and use in applications such as AI-assisted browsing, recommendation systems, or data curation.

Break them into chunks: Big files are split into smaller readable parts.

Turn chunks into numbers: Each chunk is converted into a list of numbers called an embedding — like a brainprint of meaning.

Save these brainprints: We store them in a searchable memory (a "vector database").

Later: You can ask questions, and it will find the most relevant chunks, like a supercharged index.

It's like teaching a digital assistant what's in your folder, so you can ask it questions instead of digging through files.

folder, including the use of Ollama embeddings:
Vector Database Experimentation on the Cognetics Repository
The objective of this experiment is to construct a semantic indexing and retrieval system specifically for the
cognetics
folder, leveraging state-of-the-art embedding techniques to facilitate advanced information retrieval.
Methodology:
Corpus Selection:
The dataset consists exclusively of documents and code files contained within the
cognetics
folder of the repository. This targeted approach ensures domain specificity and relevance.
Preprocessing and Chunking:
Documents are parsed and segmented into smaller, semantically coherent chunks. This segmentation is critical to maintain manageable input sizes for embedding generation and to increase retrieval precision by narrowing the search scope.
Embedding Generation:
Each chunk is converted into a high-dimensional vector embedding using Ollama's embedding model. Ollama embeddings encode semantic and contextual information from text into numerical representations in vector space, enabling meaningful similarity comparisons.
Vector Storage:
Generated embeddings are stored in a vector database optimized for nearest neighbor search (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone, or similar). This storage facilitates efficient similarity queries over the embedding space.
Semantic Search and Retrieval:
User queries are similarly embedded and matched against the vector database to retrieve chunks with the highest semantic similarity. This approach transcends traditional keyword search by leveraging the embeddings' ability to capture latent semantic relationships.
Significance:
This experiment demonstrates the application of embedding-based vector search to domain-specific knowledge bases, here focusing on
cognetics
materials. By utilizing Ollama embeddings, the system gains robust semantic understanding, enabling precise retrieval of relevant documents or code snippets. This framework lays the groundwork for advanced querying, summarization, and knowledge discovery within specialized technical corpora.

The goal of this experiment is to develop a semantic indexing and retrieval system for the
`cognetics`
folder, using state-of-the-art embedding techniques to enable advanced, context-aware search capabilities.
## Methodology
1.
**Corpus Selection**
We focus exclusively on documents and code within the
`cognetics`
folder to ensure domain specificity and relevance.
2.
**Preprocessing and Chunking**
Files are parsed and split into smaller, semantically coherent chunks to optimize embedding generation and improve retrieval granularity.
3.
**Embedding Generation**
Each chunk is transformed into a high-dimensional vector embedding using Ollama's embedding model. These embeddings capture semantic and contextual information in numerical form, allowing meaningful similarity comparisons.
4.
**Vector Storage**
The embeddings are stored in a vector database optimized for efficient nearest neighbor search, enabling rapid retrieval of semantically related chunks.
5.
**Semantic Search and Retrieval**
Queries are converted into embeddings and matched against the stored vectors, returning the most semantically relevant chunks. This approach enables nuanced search beyond keyword matching.
## Significance
By applying Ollama embeddings to the
`cognetics`
corpus, this experiment illustrates how embedding-based vector search can facilitate precise and context-aware retrieval in specialized technical domains. This system provides a foundation for enhanced knowledge discovery, summarization, and intelligent querying within domain-specific repositories.

how to get tree output with file sizes ?
ChatGPT said:
To get a
tree-like directory listing with file sizes
in the terminal, you can use the
tree
command with some options:
bash
Copy code
tree -h
-h
prints the
file sizes in a human-readable format
(e.g., KB, MB).
By default,
tree
shows the directory structure in a tree format.
Example output:
css
Copy code
.
├── file1
.txt
[4.0K]
├── subfolder
│   └── file2
.png
[1.2M]
└── script
.py
[10K]
If
tree
is not installed:
On
Ubuntu/Debian
:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install tree
On
macOS
(with Homebrew):
bash
Copy code
brew install tree
Additional useful options:
-L N
— limit tree depth to N levels, e.g.:
bash
Copy code
tree -h -L 2
-a
— show hidden files.
Let me know if you want a command for Windows PowerShell or other shells!
