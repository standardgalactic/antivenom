So we were talking about sort of right or wrong, right?
What does it mean to be right or wrong
and getting your ideas out there into the world?
And it reminds me of a couple things.
Richard Hamming talks about the tolerance of ambiguity
and that you have to both believe and disbelieve.
That he says to work on an idea, like in physics, for say,
you have to believe in the idea enough
that you can train in it and understand the background material.
But to make progress, you have to disbelieve.
You have to see that maybe the theory is not complete.
Maybe it has holes in it that need to get patched up.
And so you have to simultaneously believe and disbelieve.
And I think this can apply to every controversial topic.
And it also reminds me of an interview with Richard Hamming.
I'm sorry, with Richard Feynman.
And Richard Feynman, he's discussing an idea and an opinion.
And he has a rather strong opinion.
I forget the topic.
And he's going along and going along.
And then he says, wait, nope.
I take it all back.
I take it all back.
And then he argues in the other direction.
Sort of mid-interview, he's not afraid to just suddenly snap something into place
and reconsider everything and argue and completely on the other side.
And I think that that takes a lot of courage,
both to simultaneously believe and disbelieve at the same time.
It can feel a little schizo.
And also to have the comfort to realize that you can change your mind
and that there's nothing wrong with that.
And so I encourage everybody to practice both of those.
Tolerate ambiguity and never be afraid to change your mind.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
