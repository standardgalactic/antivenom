so we're gonna have a little bit of fun I'm gonna try to go through the slides
relatively quickly so we can have a little bit of a discussion maybe some
biology but really this is more about a social experiment to give a little bit
background on myself before I went to finishing up at Harvard men now I did a
PhD at Oxford metabolism I think like a lot of people here I just love to read
cell science and nature I get really excited about biology metabolism
whatever field of science you're in but you want to find a way to communicate
that awe to like a broader public or something I've really become interested
in is like how to translate love and awe for my field to a broad audience so this
was a stunt I pulled around January where we're studying a topic that I'll get
into this phenotype around lipids and cholesterol sometimes people go low
carb the cholesterol was through we'll go by that you know go over why that is but
based on this model I had a kind of bold hypothesis that I could do something
like use or your cookies lower my cholesterol so I was gonna ask rhetorically
but all right you have on the left here status they are standard of care for
cholesterol lowering sure everybody here knows somebody on statin medication I think
a trillion dollar drug industry and then on the right we have milk's favorite
cookie the Oreo and so what if I told you I were to do an experiment where I
compared these head-to-head for cholesterol lowering in a particular
context though and that's one of the big ideas I want to hammer home this little
talk is that when you have a bio marker we've talked about a lot of biomarkers today if
you look at it like my optically there's a lot of different reasons a given
biomarker can change we heard about RDW earlier you can have like iron deficiency
anemia and change your RDW other reasons maybe changes in you know stem cell
population that would change that biomarker cholesterol is the same it can go up
for many different reasons so you can have a genetic mutation and the
cholesterol receptor the LDL receptor so you're not clearing a lot and your LDL
particles will go up your cholesterol will go up that's the genetic conditions
hopefully a little hypercholesterolemia some people are more sensitive to
saturated fat so butter people here you know butter is going to increase your
cholesterol now there might be different ideologies different ideologies that
people aren't aware of something we've been studying for a while is this
phenomenon of lean mass hyper responder where particularly in the context of
carbohydrate restriction lean generally fit insulin sensitive people have these
skyrocketing cholesterol levels and when I say skyrocketing I literally mean I will
rock walk around like Harvard Medical School campus if I tell my attending
physicians the levels that we see they think it's a joke or that I'm like
misreading the labs they don't believe it because it's equivalent to homozygous
familial hypercholesterolemia and something so one in one million genetic disease that
most physicians won't see in their lifetime the reason we think we see these
levels is at a very high level in lean insulin sensitive people when you have a
fuel shift from burning carbs and burning fat say if you cut all carbohydrates from
your diet then you need to rely on fat energy as a fuel and fat energy can be
carried around the body by particles that contain cholesterol so when you get say
like a in blood panels is your LDL cholesterol so called bad cholesterol
that's the cholesterol fraction in that group of particles so this is where we
get into a little bit of the biology but again this isn't really a talk about
biology this is the model we have for how this works basically if you
carbohydrate restrict so you go on a ketogenic diet the glycogen levels in your
liver go low and then a precursor to the LDL that you might measure on a panel is
this VLDL this VLDL gets shipped out and they're basically carrying fat fuel which
they use to replenish fat tissue those little yellow blobs there and fuel
muscle and basically this turnover process ends up generating high
cholesterol as an epiphenomenon I won't go into details of it again because
that's not really the point I want to make but you end up with what appears to
be I mean almost you could say a paradox is like this is what we see in period
clinically that if you take the population of people and you put them on
low-carb diets irrespective of even saturated fat intake you would think okay
if high cholesterol is quote bad that is the people that are less healthy then
might have the quote bad response but it's not what we see it's the opposite of
what we see in fact people with obesity they eat for example class 2 obesity will
tend to see a decrease in cholesterol people with overweight or class 1 obesity
won't see a change and it's the lean insulin sensitive people in a dose
dependent manner let's see the increases in LDL sometimes to astronomical levels
so on a mixed diet I'm eating just a regular diet my LDL will be around 90 I cut
out carbohydrates I can get to over 500 and again pretty irrespective of my like
saturated fat intake and actually we have a meta-analysis of RCTs which I don't go
into it here but when you do the meta analysis of 41 human randomized control
trials you see this pattern across those human randomized control trials so the
signal is there now to demonstrate the principle I think we all know here like
if you have a model this is our liquid energy model if I go back you want to try
to break it not try to confirm it so what can I do that was like a bold test of this
model that would also maybe catch some eyes and get a discussion started well one
thing you can say is if I just replace the glycogen source then the flywheel should
stop spinning and it should attenuate the cholesterol levels so you could do
that actually we've done this with other carbohydrates more in swap manners so
sweet potatoes blueberries yada yada yada typically that doesn't go to the
headlines because it's not as sexy as a freaking Oreo cookie so I designed this
crossover trial which is I get a strict diet lock-in my baseline diet then for
about two weeks and it being 16 days I did a sleeve of Oreos on top of it was a pure
addition I just added Oreos to my diet then I had a three-month washout and then I
went on high-intensity stat therapy for six weeks which would be standard of care for
that high-intensity statin it was Crestor or Suvastatin for 20 mgs and based
on our model like you know I'm addressing the root cause talking about root cause
physiology then adding carbs be it a sweet potato this isn't a swap so I'm not
removing that action adding fat and saturated fat because we always have that
that should work to lower my cholesterol the interesting question is one will it
actually work because it's kind of a bold experiment and two how does it compare the
standard of care therapy with you know a drug that's part of a multi-billion or
trillion-dollar drug industry so here are the results which was in one-third the
timeframe the Oreo cookies were two times as powerful as high-intensity statin
therapy which is a provided binding now and it's published it achieved its ends so this is
what I really want to talk about and what I would love questions on of really
forcing a conversation because I think
to think about how we ask hard questions stimulate debate have you know dialogue
about the things that we're each passionate about because we all have our
passions like and how do we amplify that to what extent is there a role in our
current era for let's call it legitimacy or publicity stunts self-experiments things
like that I think for me as you know a young scientist finishing medical school
thinking about like how I want to communicate to a broader audience it's a
very interesting time to be alive and engaging with this space because you have
this inevitable clash between academia and social media in the media and this
game you kind of have to play if you want to have a voice so this was my first
kind of a social experiment is if I do this what spiral out what spirals out of
that and ended up going to conferences talking there was even you know clinical
follow-up positive clinical follow-up because physicians cardiologists you know
primary care practitioners who weren't aware of what the ten other papers they
have on this topic then became aware of it and the underlying model because of
this goofy stunt and then they started implementing that with their patients
including those who were drug intolerant so there were patients that like
couldn't take stands for whatever reason or didn't want to and now they're
having better cholesterol reduction effects by virtue of me doing what
seemed as a very goofy publicity stunt and beyond that I mean some of the
things I call this I like to call it productive provocation one it increases
awareness of pre-existing literature so again we have a meta-analysis of human
randomized control for us people weren't aware of they're now aware of it and it's
clinical relevance because of at least not like this it stimulates open-minded
discussion I am a very passionate and driven person the flip side of that is
I'm incredibly impatient so when certain discussions weren't happening I just
decided like look I want to force this discussion and how am I going to do that
and this kind of experiment was one idea I had research funding it's like pretty
crazy I there's a lot of products I want to do in the metabolic health space I'm 20
years old the NIH isn't gonna give me ten million dollars for these projects you
develop a presence and develop a voice that you can get funding through
philanthropy so I have one project now it's going to be 1.9 million dollars and
that money could be accessible to me by virtue of accessing different pools that
have become accessible and arisen because of these sort of N equals one
experiments new partnerships and honestly it's just kind of fun so kind of like I
present this as a social experiment because I think it's pretty implicit the
pros and cons that could come with communicating science in this sort of way
and I try to do a pretty honest self audit of like what the real world impacts of
these sort of things are because I can't say with confidence before I do this this
is just gonna have net positive impact I could never know that and it's
something that I put a lot of thought into before doing it nevertheless I think it's a
direction we will see things trending I also sense a lot of enthusiasm for the
whole idea of N equals one science and people engaging in the scientific process
applying it to their own life and their own health so I think there's a broader
discussion to be had here but this I just found was a this is my first foray
into the kind of an interesting case study in demonstrating science and also I
think there was some fun science behind it so that I'll stop talking and see if there's any questions
you're different ignore us one of the contentions and some of the publications
around us a phenotype is perhaps around the HDL LDL ratio in the last five to ten years there's been
increasing confidence about LDL in particular ACOV being predictive as a good surrogate for
cardiovascular mortality whereas GWAS studies and others have shown HDL is not necessarily conferred
protection I wonder if you have any plans in your work prospectively validating for the HDL the LDL
changes whether those correlate in the hypothesized direction first yeah I think I have a two part
answer to that question one is so when we talk about APOV particles or you know LDL particles they can
have a causal relationship with ASCVD without that necessarily applying that there's an absolute
there's a high absolute risk in every individual so a lot of the ideas of causality have been drawn out
for example of Mendelian randomization studies which are by their basis based on like variation in the
genetic pool and so what we're seeing here is a metabolic response so I think it's inappropriate to
extrapolate from the Mendelian randomization trials something about the absolute risk associated with
APOV in a Mendel a genetic response scenario in addition to that the way I you know look at or think
or want to think about these patterns so in this lean mass type of responder pattern with high LDL high HDL
and low triglycerides I'm not of the opinion and I see this misunderstanding a lot like Peter Attia will say
like oh people think that the you know low triglycerides and HDL protective I don't think that I think
that the pattern of metabolites that arises is a biological fingerprint of underlying physiology so
you see that the same with like metabolic vulnerability scores we have a bunch of markers and it's not that
they have a direct causal relationship but it's that their pattern tells you something with underlying
metabolic health the physiology which I think is more important and then in addition to that I guess
third part of my answer is with the LDL and the APOV particles just because there is a causal
relationship does not tell you about like the slope of that relationship in different scenarios and if
you have different etiologies have arise it would be inappropriate to expect the same risk burn so
it's all well and dandy to say oh if I can snap my finger and change the singular biomarker my risk for
the singular outcome will be reduced but then you say well how much is it reduced and what are the
real-world costs because actual real-life interventions you know change other variables
um so you know it's not something I would deal with flippantly I mean like I'm not I don't want
to gamble on my own heart for example like this is literally my life on the line but I think it's
something we have to have new more nuanced discussions about and I will say we are doing prospective trials on
lean mass hyper-responders actually we have one paper under submission now which does look at plat
progression and also the predictors of plat progression in this population and I'll say
because I don't think this is I think I'm allowed to say this there are some people in the lean mass
hyper-responder population who do have plat progression the next question is though is Apple be predicting
progression at all in that population and if not what else is and I'll kind of leave that as cliffhanger
because that paper is currently understood but thank you for the question thank you and I'm glad that
you're following up with prospective studies because I think we agree the jury's out we need to in terms
of the net effect and it's exactly for people who are managing their own lipids uh there are clear
guidelines based on what we know right now but we need the prospective data based on that hypothesis
that determines that and I would never challenge those I mean I think you know the funny thing about
these experiments you're always going to come with someone that like layers on their perceptions like
Nick's trying to change the guidelines with the goofy n equals one I'm like no I'm not I'm trying to
start this conversation that we need to have because I think that there is a myopic discussion around
this and often the dismissive one and I think something that and forgive me for speaking out of turn
as a medical student but that some some clinicians in social in social media space don't fully appreciate is
the dangers of a paternalistic approach in those spheres because that degrades trust
and everybody might not have a medical or scientific background but people can tell
when you're condescending to them and that creates a rebellion which is dangerous
depending where you're seeing more thank you
remind everybody where they can find you um any social media nick norwitz last name n-o-r-w-i-t-z
i do not know any other nick norwitz on the planet so i'm pretty used to find
what are the things that we can find that missing so we certainly wanna know and?
is
you
