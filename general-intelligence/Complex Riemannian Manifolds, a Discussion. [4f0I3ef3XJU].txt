Hi, my name is Michael Ostroff and I am a PhD student here at FAU. Today I would like to talk
to you about what is known as complex Riemannian manifolds. These are actually distinct from
what are conventionally known as complex manifolds in several different ways. In fact,
they are a lot more similar to normal real manifolds you would find in general relativity
than complex manifolds. Before I get to them I need to start with an analogy.
You are all familiar with the wave equation I would assume. Imagine you take a rock and you
throw it into a pond and you can see how the waves ripple outwards from that. That is essentially how
the wave equation works where the system evolves over time. When we normally think about it we
think of it as having a real value defined everywhere for real coordinates. This acts
exactly as how we expect it would and you could take some like real function which like actually
you take a meromorphic function I should say and that like you can plug in like ct and x as like
two coordinates and you could make it such that on like for a real real
