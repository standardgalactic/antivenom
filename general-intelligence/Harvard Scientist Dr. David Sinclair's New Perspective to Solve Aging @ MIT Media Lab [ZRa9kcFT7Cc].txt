all right everyone welcome back today we have an extremely special guest
probably one of the most prolific researchers in the aging and longevity field dr david sinclair give
it up hey everyone very busy man he could make it in person but i think he's still going to deliver
something extremely interesting today so let's pay extra attention uh so i have about 20 minutes yeah
and if you have time after you can ask some questions and then uh gladyshev is joining us
out there in person great i was yeah i was just uh talking with him he's great to have too uh good
well unfortunately i couldn't be there today i'm i'm here at home with uh with family uh but yeah i
wanted to drop by it sounds like what you're doing today is an unusual thing and i thought i'd join in
on that um and present some unusual things and what i'm going to present to you today is something
uh a lot of these slides i've never presented before i pulled them out of the archives
uh about uh 2014 um i had a phase where i was just writing down notes constantly uh drawing slides
drawing uh equations and um and i've never shown them in public before uh they led to lifespan the book
they've led to pretty much all the work that we've been doing in my lab since um and it's still i still
use these thoughts uh to to drive my labs hypotheses and it's a very different way of thinking than most
labs uh when it comes to aging and um i'm happy to share with some of them with you today uh and what i was
actually trying to do was to come to grips with a lot of experiments that weren't making any sense
at the time that's the way often the way science goes right you have a paradigm shift uh that's
necessary because the current paradigm just doesn't make any sense and some of the things that weren't
making any sense were that you could increase dna damage in a mouse and it would live a normal lifespan
and um but in my lab we were creating special types of dna damage and we're accelerating aging so
how do you reconcile that um what is it about these sirtuins that we've been working on since i was at mit
and uh you know what is it is it really just that we break down or is it something more than that
and uh through a wormhole a deep dive i would say i got really deep into information theory
i got deep into the work of claude shannon and his colleagues and even earlier and things clicked
they started to really make sense to me that uh aging isn't so much a a linear process it's a circular
process uh and that aging is unlikely just to be wear and tear but it's actually a software problem
and i began looking for ways to test that and we still continue to test that there are times in my
lab where we have still have confusing results and we we're challenging this hypothesis all the time but
compared to uh 10 years ago we we are much more i i should say i'm much more enthusiastic about it
um because it really is it's explaining a lot of things that are have been going on not just in my
lab now but but globally um and you'll hear more about that from vadim about uh epigenetic clocks and
you know we've been working in my lab on epigenetics since day one and uh and even before i had a lab
and so let me share some of that with you um i'm not this is going to be the first talk i don't know
maybe ever uh that i'm not going to show any data i'm happy to tell you about what we're up to and where
we're going and what the latest is um and i have some slides but uh i decided this is a different
different group of people different meeting so let's talk about something that's a little bit
more high level than messing around with cells and mice uh you'll probably get a better insight into my
brain than ever before uh so this is an old yeast cell i took a picture of it when i was uh in my 20s
i was working with lenny garanti who i owe a lot to my professor at mit and this is an old yeast cell and
what lenny and i co-published in cell in 1997 was that uh two major things happen for yeast aging one was
uh it seems to be somewhat of a program in that there's a stochastic element where you get genomic
instability the dna breaks uh you get a circle formed of of ribosomal uh ribosomal dna but after that
event happens now it's a very predictable program we could model mathematically model and predict
the lifespan of yeast cells and their offspring and all that math is actually buried in the back
of that paper and what we proposed was that the genomic instability in this organism
led to the distraction of
gene regulatory factors and it was messing up the epigenome and that gave rise to the phenotypes
of aging not just the death but the phenotypes or the characteristics of aging in yeast are similar
to us they get old they get slow they get large as you can see with this yellow acidic cell stained with
bromophenol blue um they become sterile and uh and we could change the lifespan of a yeast cell by
creating these circles of dna or breaking the dna in just a few defined places that would accelerate
aging including the sterility and the size and the slowness and we could do the opposite we could
actually slow down the formation of these and uh other colleagues in the lab made mutations that
prevented circles from forming as frequently and as the model predicted uh the e-cells lived longer
and maintained their fertility and so that led to uh a real shift because at the time in the 1990s
when i arrived at mit the idea was that aging was caused by damage
so we expected in genetic screens to find antioxidant enzymes but instead we found genes that controlled
other genes silencing proteins which we now call sirtuins uh there's a lot known about sirtuins and
and there's a lot of not a lot of people but there's a few people who still claim that it's debatable
it's not really debatable we know how these enzymes work we know how to activate them with small molecules
as you can see in this review by michael bunkowski and i um and so you know i've spent a lot of my
career trying to help people be healthier so i've been co-developing molecules that can activate these
enzymes so you don't just have to fast or exercise to get the the benefits so these enzymes what they
do in yeast and in humans in large part is they stabilize the epigenome and they repair broken
chromosomes and they actually physically move we think between silencing and controlling genes and
repairing dna and that's important for the hypothesis too but what's important about sirtuins named after
the original sirtu gene is that sir stands for information and so that's obviously been driving
my quest to understand what is it about information that's relevant to aging so this is a series of slides
that i drew in uh the early teens of this century uh and so you know these are these are ideas these
are not published these are you can see what kind of things that i was thinking about at the time
and i was thinking you know maybe we just need to revise the old paradigm and instead of thinking about
stages of damage leading to aging maybe aging really is a circle and that it it's malleable and we can
not just accelerate it which we were doing at the time it's all published now but we could even
reverse that process we could reset the epigenome if that's truly involved and you can see here i was
writing things like resettable epigenome and we were looking to use the yamanaka factors
potentially to do that um and of course belmonte one calls belmonte deserves huge credit for
being the first to do this in vivo to show in vivo you could actually uh very carefully
treat a mouse with yamanaka factors and not kill it and actually make it healthier and longer lived
um and we we have stood on his shoulders as well um i i'm fascinated with um cell identity
of course the epigenome gives cells their identity it's what allows development to happen
it's how you get an embryo from a single cell and the idea at the time was maybe we get what i would
i came up with at the time was called epigenetic drift that due to insults to perhaps the chromosome
dna breaks circles of dna these distract the epigenetic regulators and what were once very
powerful boundaries um and and accurate gene expression levels become um smooth and actually
you get don't get the beautiful pattern of gene expression and i did some mathematical modern
modeling of that that helped my thinking and then inspired by claude shannon's work i started going nuts
about analog versus digital information and noise and and the observer which you'll see later and started
to model biological noise uh in the same way that shannon modeled informational and digital noise and i
started to realize there were two types of information in the body there was digital information which is
uh dna and a lot of the epigenome which is just as important for life and longevity uh is analog analog
information is stored in the body as uh structures of how the dna is actually wrapped and it's in four
dimensions it's not in in one or two and uh i started to think about correction data was there
correction data in really stored in every cell and we started to look for it um and we were wondering
how do we go back like claude shannon suggested to uh not just slow down the noise but actually reset
the information in the cell here i'm saying maybe it's it's stored in the form of rna and dna
and the output of all of this system uh is life and longevity and then i started to think about what
makes us different and similar as species and this was an idea where the epigenetic landscape which gives
beautiful gene expression um this is of course modeled after waddington's landscape is that current
interventions are trying to slow down this bouncing of the of this uh virtual cell that's trying to
not trying but can jump across valleys but it doesn't when we're young because these boundaries
epigenetic boundaries which manolis has beautifully defined um they erode over time we think partly due to
cell stress and broken chromosomes now we've got more entropy less boundaries in the epigenome and now
you can see that cells can jump from one cell type to another they don't really jump but we do see them
drift and actually experiments that we've now published show that older cells are easier to reprogram
into different cell types because the boundaries of their their cell type are lower um and perhaps
i was i was thinking at the time perhaps a species that lives a long time like a bowhead whale or a
greenland shark would have less vibration fewer uh dna breaks uh but also greater stability of the
the boundaries that keep cells their id and maintain their identity so that even an old
chronologically old greenland shark compared to us at the same age at let's say 90 years old would
have greater ability well perhaps here is what we would compare to this uh has greater boundaries
and so i was looking for ways in my lab to slow down this process by increasing sirtuin activity
increase dna repair protect the genome we've now done that some of it's published we have enzymes now
and proteins that stabilize uh the worm genome and make worms live longer we're doing this in mammals
as well but what about can we truly slow down the erosion of these landscapes and can we ever get
this cell to go back to where it was is that in is that information even possible now making a stem
cell using yamanaka factors was not going to be the solution because importantly the difference between what
yamanaka did and what i'm trying to do here is that yamanaka erased cell identity basically took these
hills and flattened them so that cells had no identity i'm trying here to do the opposite regain
the identity so i started to call this process um x differentiation um richard cutler has called it
dis differentiation um and then the re-differentiation would be the reset
uh and this is a waddington's landscape of the epigenome during development
and uh in this review and perspective with one chang lu uh and xiao qian from my lab at the time
we've extended the waddington landscape out into the future
so now it includes the adult and the old individual and you can see that the cells that
were once in a beautiful valley are now uh more likely to move around the landscape and lose their
identity and losing our identity is a real problem right you you're probably more susceptible to diabetes
alzheimer's even cancer and we've we've written about that that as well for cancer it's called the
gronkogenesis hypothesis
so this is more of a fully formed depiction of the theory that we've published and of course if
anyone has read claude shannon's mathematical theory of aging papers in 1948 parts a and b they will
recognize this i have stolen it and just replace some of the the boxes with biology rather than than
math and uh numbers and it's similar though that our bodies are like information that gets transferred
across time and space there's noise that's introduced by damage to cells and eventually
the information is lost and most of it is epigenetic and analog information because analog information is
much harder to maintain over a lifetime than digital of course you'll appreciate that that's the reason we
live in a digital world the major reason is that it's less subject to noise and even if you do lose
digital information you can go back with the tcpip protocol and find the missing bits with what
claude shannon was calling the observer um now we call it the backup copy and we've been looking in
my lab for first of all how do you contact the observer uh and what is it made of where is epigenetic
youthful information stored and we have evidence that it exists which is really exciting so we use this
paradigm to uh cure blindness in mice we're now improving vision in blind monkeys at life biosciences
here in boston and hopefully we'll if all goes well uh treat a human for blindness next year um
or if if you know perhaps even uh multiple uh diseases not just uh regular blindness but perhaps
glaucoma macular degeneration uh perhaps one day in all an entire human but we're starting with the eye
if you're wondering because for gene therapy it's the best place to start it's an enclosed immune
privileged location in the body one of the papers we published that was really inspirational for this
theory or driver uh was what we we used to call this theory uh but it was a terrible name uh it was
called the relocalization of chromatin modifiers hypothesis um and it was a 2008 cell paper by philip
obrador for postdoc at the time uh and of course many collaborators and what we found was that in
vitro and in mice we could uh create double standard breaks and see the movement of epigenetic regulators
including the sirtuins uh now we know sort one sort six uh hdac one um other labs have shown this they
move to the break gene expression changes in response to this over a matter of minutes
but not all of the factors go back to where they came from so that the genes that are here
over time become deregulated even if the dna is repaired 100 there is an epigenetic scar
because of that previous dna damage which is important to remember right because we're so trained
to think dna is our destiny that even if dna isn't mutated it can have a lasting effect on a on an organ
and our cells experience a few dna breaks every day depending on the on the cell type of course
sometimes it's more than that i fly a lot so i have more than that uh x-rays ct scans will accelerate that
we forget that even if our body is 100 effective at repairing that it doesn't mean that the cell is
the same as it was uh this is uh in that same review and i want to use this to re-emphasize the
point that we're not trying to make stem cells or go anywhere near a stem cell it's often misunderstood
this theory is often misunderstood that what we're trying to do is push cells into a stem-like state
which allows them to then be healthier we don't see evidence of that in fact what we think we're
looking at is something in between which is the cells regain their identity their function but if
you push them too hard like the yamanaka was doing in vitro then you go back to this early blue stage here
of being a stem cell but we're really looking at taking cells that have lost their identity and
getting them back to being young but not too young and that was the trick that took us years to do and
we almost gave up because we kept getting stem cells rather than um differentiated cells uh interesting
fact is that uh nalat a graduate student in the lab is applying this theory to cancer cells
and it's often thought that we'll make cancer cells worse if we reprogram them because the mind goes
straight to this stem cell state but remember we're actually regain we're trying to regain identity and
if you make a cell that's cancerous or oncogenic regain its identity uh first of all i think it's going
to behave better uh second of all what we're finding in practice in at least in cell lines is that the cells
in this process of re-differentiating they kill themselves it makes sense right you wake up from
a zombie-like state and you see all the trouble that you're causing and you you probably want to
get rid of yourself so that's what we're seeing in in cell lines um just really briefly the one of the
reasons that i'm enthusiastic about there being a repository of epigenetic information in every cell
is this kind of data this came out in 2020 and uh from one chang's paper and this is a dna methylation
pattern across the entire genome of retinal ganglion cells these nerves that go from the eye to the brain
and this is the pattern in the young rgcs the old look like this the negative control untreated is this
and the last one two three four mice the pattern is remarkably similar to the younger animals so think
about that that across tens of thousands of sites on the genome the cells are able to restore
many of those methylation sites the same is true for transcription if we look at these same cells
the reason that those dots which represent each one a locus a separate rna
it's not a perfect straight line but it's pretty damn exciting that a gene that loses its expression by
twofold during aging roughly gains its expression by twofold during reprogramming
and the point that i want to make is how is that possible is it simply just transcription factors
interacting with transcription factors interacting with more transcription factors
which interact with dna demethyl transferases and demethylases um maybe but i'm i'm betting that
that there's more than that that there's a physically at these genes there's something that we're missing
a memory of the the gene expression state and the chromatin state that that cell should be in if it gets
rejuvenated and so why would it exist you might ask well i i've written that this is likely to be
a program that life has had since the very beginning to regrow to rejuvenate we have
so-called immortal species like jellyfish and worms that can be cloned um we can even clone us you know
mammals we could clone ourselves if it weren't illegal and so how is that possible how can you reset
cells how can you regrow tissues when they've been cut out like a liver out of a human leaving only a
small piece behind i think there is a repository of youthful information that we're tapping into
by in this case this experiment we're over expressing
three of the yamanaka genes oct4 sox2 and kalif4 we leave out cmyc which is an oncogene and we find
it very safe this is the the method we're going to use in in humans and then just lastly uh for lack
of time i need to end but this is the kind of thinking that we have that there are tags at genes that
um have lost their gene expression and they may be tags on the dna there might be tags on proteins
there might be rna uh they might be a new type of information we're looking at all of this and i've
given something publicly i've given some examples of what these lead candidates that we're going after
might look like when this pattern is laid down i don't know it could be during development it could be
during the teenage years when we're at our optimal uh it could be a mix of all of that
but first we have to find them and so right now if you're wondering what we're doing um chris petty in
the lab and uh and others who are working with him are destroying these these marks hypothetical marks
and seeing if reprogramming is also destroyed um we're also enhancing the marks to see if we can enhance
rejuvenation and reversal of aging and uh and this is my last slide i believe where aging is the loss
of cell identity with with age and what we're doing uh in our work is taking a cell that's lost its identity
and regaining it so that it can express those genes beautifully like it did when it was young
in a semi-permanent way this is not just you know do it for two hours and it goes away we can re rejuvenate
a mouse's eye and cure blindness with bruce cassander's lab who's here at harvard and we've now published
since the first paper that this effect lasts nearly to the end of the mouse's life the mouse only dies
because the rest of its organs are old but its eyes are still really young which is interesting to think
about we also know we can reset more than once um and it's a lot of brilliant people's work that i've
had the fortune uh to present to you today and i've mentioned people along the way but i want to thank
the people who have collaborated for the last well 25 years that have made this possible thank you i'm
happy to answer a few questions give it up for david sinclair
you have many uh fans in the audience of fans of you the dean who's in the background and michael
levin and call first and all these people that are sort of taking this more mathematical and sort
of info-theoretic approach to biology and uh many of you have some really good questions now is the time
for david you mentioned mike levin while while you're picking people uh it's i love mike's work
and i'm as we've he and i have discussed we're excited about the possibility of intersection between
what we do and what he's discovering wonderful i have some questions
so my question is david can you hear yes okay go for it so
is it possible to like look at it as a cellular automator uh like a neural cellular automator
with like stresses and rewards to the system uh is it possible to like describe the system like this
david now is the time to talk about hormesis i i think i understood the question it was a little
bit fuzzy um so we see a lot of cell autonomous uh effects with reprogramming as well um and
the the link to hormesis is that uh
uh this program if you want to call it a program and actually i i would call it a program because it
seems to be uh what do you call it reusing aspects of embryonic development uh that this program is
designed to respond to the the milieu the environment and during development of course there's different
uh environmental factors often from neighboring cells but as you become an adult the net the
environment that's super important is uh the liquid that you're around which is influenced by
how you live what you eat uh how much you've slept how much you've exercised and that
seems to turn on these defense pathways in each cell independently the sirtuins come on for example there
are others uh mtor and uh npk are popular ones they all talk to each other so there's no one that's more
important than the other despite what the field likes to argue about and uh and so yeah
you know it's a long a long answer to a question and i worry that i didn't fully understand the
question but you know if you want to guide me and help me uh focus on one aspect you know feel free to
tell me yeah he's actually working on a project inspired by you and michael lovin for this for
this event so definitely let's yeah so i was looking at like uh uh looking at it
so i'm looking at like practical expressions uh of like the gene uh like trying to use like uh you know
fractal calculus a bit or like trying to like understand like uh if it's possible
that the way this is acting is like it's trying to reach a thermodynamic state like an equilibrium
kind of uh because like it has like it has prior estimation uh like i'm basing on the like assumption
that it has like a genetic uh like image of what it wants to be and like it's trying to reach this
like equilibrium and i'm trying to explain it through like uh practical math and i don't know
if it's like the right way to go about it yeah
well i'm going to say something that might not be uh relevant to your question but i i'll say it
anyway because that's what academics do when they they're not sure about the question um i i love um
um these these new life forms that that sounds like you're working on and mike has published on and
it's an important way to look at life uh too often we look at organisms as organisms
um but cells are organisms right we're just it's a very large colony and because we've got consciousness
we think of this as a single thing but of course it's not uh it's very complex and but the cells are
the cells are things right cells cells want to survive they want to generally they want to reproduce
they like finding partners they like interacting they're very social uh and i think what you're
tapping into what mike has tapped into is that fundamental uh aspect of life that's been with us since
the first proto-organisms uh and that's why in my book i i pretty much started it with the beginning
of life because i truly believe that understanding the beginnings of life help us understand life at
this stage and being able to recreate those interactions is just wonderful and i think a really
great path to understanding life at its fundamental level and how cells fight for survival
um as individuals in the same way that together we fight as organisms
any other questions oh actually this is softly but actually student at the 11 lab and he's one of
the smartest kids i've ever met so he's going to ask you something cool okay so um one one thought
i've had this is going to be somewhat peripherally related to your actual work but it builds off the
theme in the answer you just gave there so one thing i've noticed about this more information
theoretic view of biology is that the distinction between you know bigger agents like human beings
or large animals and cells acting as agents together to you know do certain outcomes becomes somewhat
blurred right because less important is the actual scale of the organism we're looking at and more
important in a sense is a computational power or expressivity of the organism we're looking at
but of course humans us humans have consciousness if you have this collection of cells with you know
conflicting agencies and so on and they give rise to emergent so sort of more complicated emergent
behavior i wonder how we can distinguish complicated emergent behavior in general and conscious
complicated emergent behavior and whether you have any thoughts on that this is a massive question so
oh wow um i'm surprised you haven't also brought in um language models into that uh it we are in an
incredible time right that we're finally seeing ways to approach consciousness um artificial consciousness
um and what's surprising a lot of us um including by his own admission sam altman uh is that it's
the exponential effect you get with linear scaling and the it sounds too good to be true that if you just
build it big enough it will come but so far it looks like that might be true
and i think what life basically is uh is uh even from the molecule to the cellular level and then the
cell to the tissue tissue to the animal the animal to the society um is that effect is that when you get
enough of individuals things together emergent properties come from that and
and now with with uh agi potentially uh we we see evidence of that i think we'll see in the next
five years that that's true that and this is the reason why google is now building nuclear reactors
there's a race to be big and big new things will happen and the brain is the best example right now of
that is yeah our brain is slightly different right there are parts of the of the brain that are
different than a monkey and there are some genes that create more contacts
but fundamentally it's not that different uh and there are other species with different types of brains
like an octopus that have consciousness and so it's we're not that special but we do have a pretty
compact big brain and this you know size doesn't matter it turns out in um surprisingly
uh and so you know i think that your question is a really good one is what is it about about
consciousness uh and the interactions and the scale that seems to uh make all this possible and what is it
about that that leads to emergent properties um i'm also happy to to have you ask a second question
given my answer if there's more thought that you have
i'll think on it a bit first let's see if anyone else has things to ask and we can come back to this
well yeah maybe any of you in the back any questions nope last call all right that would be it no
who wants to oh he does oh one more yeah go for it um so
what's your suspicion on a say quantitative or qualitative threshold after which these
emergent properties actually emerge like do you have any suspicion because we can say that
it gets more complicated and after a certain point they come but you know having worked on
this stuff for so many years you must have some intuition about what kind of complexity
we're looking at here that's i guess what i'm interested in do you mean intelligence or biology or aging
let's say uh yeah consciousness like that that kind of threshold gosh well i
yeah i'm asking for your personal view here yeah well the disclaimer is i'm just a yeast biologist um
i but i i have been fascinated with consciousness i think anyone who
really stops to think should be fascinated by this um my simple view of consciousness and i've i've
explored my own brain with uh in india and you know tried to find out what the heck is going on in there
and what i've come to i wouldn't say conclusion i should say what i what i think is going on is
uh the more conscious you are uh is dependent on how easily you or how often you can observe
the process of thought and then you can observe the observation of the process of thought
and then you can observe that and observe that and it uh eventually i don't know where that ends
uh with with uh computing because that's also nearly infinite the ability of a electronic mind to observe
itself um and and even change its thoughts in the process you know we're terrible at that as humans
most of us never really gain control over our thoughts or our emotions we try there are some
gurus and monks that managed somewhat but most of the time we're just basically animals reacting to
others and uh getting offended and getting upset and uh but yeah true consciousness is the ability
to watch yourself think and and then watch that process so i i hopefully gave you something to think
about but i think computing is going to be fascinating to see because it's going to
not just reach consciousness in our lifetime but have many higher levels of consciousness as well
thank you awesome thank you hopefully we'll uh catch you next time in person sounds good
we'll see you bye david bye
