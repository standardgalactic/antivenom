it seems that so much of the world is hidden behind academic disciplines that if we look in
the library of you know the dewey decimal system where we look at the the college catalog it's
probably a better example you're kind of required to major in something and only a few essentially
double major and you're you're really not allowed particularly as a as an academic to get a get a
professorship it's very difficult to do that in an interdisciplinary field and it's very to do very
difficult to do that in sort of transdisciplinary where you're actually kind of pulling pieces
where you're not just at the overlap of two fields but you're really pulling ideas from one area to
the other that the system doesn't allow for that and because of that there's very few people in the
system in the academic system who have any formal training in multiple multiple disciplines right
try to find somebody in the medical school that's a competent programmer find try to find a programmer
that knows anything about neuroscience try to find a psychologist who knows anything about cybernetics
robotics robotics and i think that's very unfortunate we we didn't see that as much in the 50s and 60s we
i think had a lot more crosstalk then and if we look at uh gray walter for example who built the first
mechanical robot tortoises he called them he was a neurologist and i often joke with the students that
alan turing didn't have a computer science degree he was a mathematician and that the rich
richard hamming who invented error correcting codes one of the most important ideas in computer
science he also was trained as a mathematician that you had very interesting work being done
at these crossroads one of the more interesting things that came out of the late the mid early 80s
was a collaborative course with richard fineman carver mead and john hopfield and as you might be aware
john hopfield just won the nobel prize for his work that kind of came out of this computational
neuroscience thinking about dynamical systems and and vectors and high dimensional spaces in the context
of of memories and and thinking and and thoughts the kind of things that we discuss in in psychology or maybe neuroscience
and i that's what we need more of especially in the next couple decades i think it's going to be critical
that that that young people break out of this mold and choose two or three majors choose two or three minors
go outside the catalog go to a liberal arts school and study physics and math go to an engineering school
and study poetry right force yourself or force the curriculum to allow you to do that because
uh that's where the important stuff happens it reminds me richard fineman when he he played the bongo
drums and when he he says that whenever he went to play the bongo drums they always happen to mention that
he was a theoretical physicist but when he went to give a physics talk they never mentioned that he was
also a bongo player and try to find yourself in that rare space
