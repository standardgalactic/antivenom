For complex manifolds, the distance is always, like, real, essentially, but for complex Riemannian
manifolds, you calculate the distance, essentially, like you would in, like, general relativity,
but because it's, there are, like, complex numbers, it can get a bit, um, confusing,
but it doesn't really matter. Essentially, when you, like, are trying to find the links of a
vector in general relativity, you take it, you multiply it by the metric tensor in order to
make it, like, a, like, covariant, and then you take the dot product of it, and it's, um,
let the covariant and contravariant, like, sells together to get, essentially, the absolute value
of that vector. If you want to find the length of that, you basically just take the square root.
Everything before the, like, square root part is, like, still, like, perfectly well-defined
on, like, complex Riemannian manifolds. The square root part, um, leaves an ambiguity of a plus or
minus one in the result. So, going back to the, like, complex one sphere, if you wanted to find
what the distance between, like, um, some part over here and, like, z equals zero, then because of
that, um, the singularity at z equals zero, that's not, like, a problematic black hole-like singularity,
it's, it's a coordinate singularity, but despite being a coordinate singularity, it's actually
impossible to remove it.
