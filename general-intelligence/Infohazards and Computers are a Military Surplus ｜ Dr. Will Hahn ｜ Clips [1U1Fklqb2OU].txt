yeah one thing i've been sort of battling or struggling with is you know how much of your
your brain space and your time do you do you spend building this map so to speak because
you know reality is the ultimate info hazard and once you start down this trail of kind of
connecting the dots um it can get to be kind of a runaway train and it will drive you mad and so
you have to balance your real world your actual life because you know we have these other goals
right and maybe this is a mean this is the immune system thing talking uh because it wants to go out
and just have a happy quiet normal existence but when you start to look through the edges of science
um you know between the lines in in the words when you start thinking about thinking and in
particularly when you dive into the historical you know trail it's it's overwhelming um
and it it really activates other parts of your brain and your mind because you start to see
a lot more and you think well how come i didn't see this before how come i couldn't perceive it
and it's that you were using a different mentality you're operating in a different mode and
you know it can be lethal if nothing else to yourself your your your your reality will
change because you start to see the world a very complicated way um but we have to be careful
and know that we're subject to kind of overfitting and i that's one of my favorite sort of metaphors
now you know i love how in the modern world we have access to all of these new terms
um from technology that the greatest philosophers and scientists didn't have access to
um things like information um things like ideas like compression ideas going viral and so on
and in machine learning we have this idea of overfitting and overfitting is when your model
it's it's working and it's tuned and it's learned everything you've given it but you haven't given
it enough data you've given it a very particular slice and i think that's the the world that we're in
now is that most people their mind functions well and we all sort of make this map but we don't
realize there's a lot of characters that we didn't necessarily include and so imagine you're looking
at a chess board and you're trying to understand how things are moving and you say i've got these
pieces and i've got the rooks i've got the knights and the pawns and all that and then someone says well
what about the stealth attack helicopter they say well that's not a piece on the chess board
but in the modern world that is a piece right we we do have so many components but most of our
still are still operating essentially in like a middle ages framework right there's there's families
and there's farms and there's factories and there's the king and then there's the the army and so on
but we're not thinking about well we have genetics we have microbiology we have quantum we have chaos
theory we have particle physics we have cosmology and to try to understand and correlate all of those
pieces all at the same time and realize those characters they're on the stage and they're doing
things and we've known about mind manipulation for a hundred years and you know we have very advanced
techniques and in computers and signals and all kinds of things we can make computers small enough
to fit in your head there's patents on radios that fit on your tooth filling you know it says well that's
for crazy people it's like but but it's patented right so there's a lot of sort of fringe stuff out
there that our immune system says oh no that's just a tv show or that's just in the movies and so
on but maybe by maybe our culture consciously or otherwise is putting these ideas with the label of
science fiction or film or fantasy precisely because we don't know how to put it into our map right now
that our model is overfit and to try to see this data point like the antikythera mechanism it doesn't fit
in the model our model is overfit in sort of this classical world and then when we see something
like a 2500 year old astronomical mechanical analog computer we just we have to ignore it it doesn't
really fit into that framework or if you look at you know the massive mainframe computers made out of
vacuum tubes that had graphical displays and light pens in the 1950s uh we think well how does that just
that doesn't make any sense we think of that as being modern having a gooey on the computer screen
and so on i love donald knuth in 1995 he turned off his email he said after 20 years he was sick of
getting emails and so he decided to turn it off right he got his email address in 1975. most people think
email showed up you know decades later and so the world it's there for much longer than we imagine
but we have kind of these horse blinders on it that simplify it to make it so that it's palatable
you know we're familiar with this idea from goldilocks right we've got the porridge the hot
and the cold and the medium porridge well in psychology there's the same kind of thing the goldilocks paradox
which suggests that our mental model of the world is tuned in a way that it's not too simple it would
just be kind of too boring but not too complicated otherwise it would just be absolutely overwhelming
and so we kind of craft this this narrative right in the middle and we say that's the world and that's
how it works um and maybe it just doesn't fit in any single human mind and that's something we have
to rethink about you know we were talking about this idea of ideas being victims of their own success and i
think nothing is is more of that nature than computers themselves uh i like to joke that all computers
are military surplus uh it's interesting the soviets had water computers that could rival the digital
computers to the mid 80s um that i was looking at fluidics for my garden in my backyard and i wanted
to find a pneumatic oscillator and in that search very quickly i came across a military server you know
just googling and it landed on mil and the document wasn't available and i had to put in a foyer request
to get this pdf of a water pump essentially um from from the 1950s and it turns out that these things
are used for rocket thrust vectoring and so it was a victim of its own success it didn't it didn't make
it into the public and so these kinds of things like a water computer they're very powerful and they
go back to hero of alexandria and they're not taught in any curriculum they're not taught in computer
science they're not taught in history one of my neuroscience students was looking at
a certain set of dynamical system equations and how you solve those on the computer and we came across
a mechanical computer for solving these and again it was hosted on a military server
you know not available uh to access and we had to kind of put in for another request to get
that and these are these are computer systems that are 75 years old nearly and they're they're not
available to young people as they go study um von neumann worked on a phase computer where you store the
zeros and ones in in the phase of an oscillator and you go to try to find this there's like one paper and
it's hosted by the nsa and you know you really it's really a head scratcher about you know these
different kinds of computers and and why we only learned about the von neumann computer why we didn't
learn about neural networks um john hopfield just won the nobel prize this week and it's fascinating
great everybody go back and look at his paper it's on emergent computation um thinking of neurons like a
dynamical system and memories as being the attractor of those dynamics and i think these are the kind
of ideas that we need to understand both biological systems like some of the stuff we've talked about
levin and others but also to understand the next generation of computing we can't just have this
power hungry ai it's you know the gpu is like running a toaster um we're going to start to think about
embedded computers things like smart dust where you're going to have untold number of computers floating
through your bloodstream in and out of your mind and in your body and they're going to have to be
extraordinarily low power and so we have to take these ideas from fluidic computing from mechanical
computing um from chemo chemical computing things like reaction diffusion and and start mapping the
things we've learned from the digital computer whether it's the transformer or neural network or whatever
it might be and and map these things to these other kinds of computer systems and uh i think that's
the the great opportunity in research for young people today uh yeah so i've got an early version
of these ideas online now you can find them on amazon i'm putting together a new polished version of that
um definitely take a look at the recent podcast with uh theories of everything
um and i hope to keep that conversation going but i encourage you to be aware of your cognitive immune
system so that you can protect yourself from potentially lethal memes that are going to be
coming down the line that maybe you wouldn't recognize as being such but maybe more importantly
so that you can see your own barriers so that you can see your own horse blinders because once you take
those off there's opportunities in front of you um both in your career and in your in your thought
space of directions normally you wouldn't be willing to go because earlier versions of yourself had
already sort of discounted those and say we're not i'm not interested in that or that's not a fruitful
direction that you'd be surprised how much intellectual progress you can make once you've realized you're holding yourself back
