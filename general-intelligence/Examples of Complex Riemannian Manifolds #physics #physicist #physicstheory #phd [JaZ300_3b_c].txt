Like the normal real manifolds in general relativity, these complex Riemannian manifolds,
they're still symmetric, like they don't become like remissioned or anything, just like symmetric
in both like the real and complex components. As a result of this, you can actually like still use
the Levi-Savita connections equation in order to get the Levi-Savita connection from the metric
tensor field, even though it's complex. It does not cause any issues whatsoever. And since you now
have the Levi-Savita connection, it's analytic, and derivatives are still like very well defined
because it's, well, analytic, then you can then go and find what the Riese curvature is. You could
find like vacuum solutions and all sorts of stuff, or maybe match. And like in the case of that complex
two-sphere, it would essentially like have like positive curvature, like you would expect. Like
let's say it's like the pot, the curvature is one everywhere, like regardless of the coordinates,
like even though they're like complex, it doesn't cause any issues whatsoever in this scenario.
