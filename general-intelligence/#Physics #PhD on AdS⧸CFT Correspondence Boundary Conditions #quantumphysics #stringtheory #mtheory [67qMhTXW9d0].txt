would like to talk about the ads cft correspondence i'm a like a classical gr physicist kind of person
the reason that the ads um cft like correspondence like one of the reasons it works is because
there's a conformal boundary for like the ads um spacetime stuff like if you were to take this um
minkowski spacetime and product it was the complex one sphere because that actually has a conformal
boundary at the center at c equals zero i think that could be um a conformal boundary you could
use to generalize the ads cft correspondence to um minkowski spacetime so for the ads cft correspondence
if my um understanding is correct quantum mechanics and all that sort of stuff that happens at the
like um boundary essentially the conformal boundary or for the case of the complex one sphere i think
that if you were to just um take our universe and like um all like the fields and stuff and you were
to then just like zoom in on that um singularity like more and more and more are like all like our
universe essentially everything which like goes on inside of it like the quantum mechanics and other
stuff that would essentially be lying basically on the singularity itself like as you like zoom in like
infinitely in this like complex plane so like that's where like our universe essentially exists and like
takes place
