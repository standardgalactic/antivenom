Hi, my name is Michael Ostroff, and I'm a PhD physics student from FAU.
You probably know that, though, based on my previous appearances on this channel.
So, in one of said appearances, I was talking about something I thought I had discovered called metric ambiguity.
The reason I originally came up with this was I was experimenting with different ways of defining the LaVece-Vita connection
in ways without using the metric tensor, and I was trying to see if that was compatible with GR.
So, I decided to do some experiments, or testing, based on the equations and the LaVece-Vita connection.
And I thought that I had proved that you were able to use any LaVece-Vita connection,
and it would, like, as long as it's, like, symmetric, then you would be able to, um,
it would be equivalent to GR, and you could use that.
But, apparently, that's not the case.
So, it turns out that there are LaVece-Vita connection fields,
by which I mean an affine connection you use for, um, like, geodesics,
um, which is symmetric, and it's lower, um, indices.
Um, it turns out that there are, it's this LaVece-Vita connection fields,
which are not metric compatible, i.e. there are no metric tensors,
like, fields, in theory, which can generate, like, said fields.
Um, and, correspondingly, there are Riemannian curvature tensors,
mixed index form to be specific, which are also not metric compatible.
The mistake in my, uh, proof for, like, metric ambiguity,
which was the idea that, um, you could do, like, gauge transformations,
or, of sorts, like, on a metric tensor field,
and basically change, like, the local value of it,
and that wouldn't affect, like, the LaVece-Vita connection field.
So, like, the idea, um, that idea was sort of rooted in equation, like,
four of my proof of metric ambiguity.
The parallel transport of the metric tensor is inherently pass-independent,
and what this means is that, um, like, there is an equation for what you get
when you parallel transport tensors around closed loops,
and it involves the Riese tensor.
And for, um, for a metric tensor, which is a rank-2 tensor,
you have to use, like, two, um, Riese tensors
with different, like, indices permutations.
And, um, something that you, um, do with this is, you, um,
um, oh, yeah, this uses the, um, Riese tensor
in its mixed index form,
and when you're multiplying it by the metric tensor,
um, this essentially lowers the contravariant index,
and now you have two copies of the Riese tensor
with, like, the first two indices, like, permutated,
and, like, they're added together.
And because, uh, um, like, the first two indices
of the Riese tensor, or the Riemannian curvature tensor,
I meant to say Riemannian curvature tensor, I'm sorry.
Um, because the first two indices of that are anti-symmetric,
this should inherently be a, um, like, advantage.
So, and that means that the, like,
the parallel transport of the metric tensor is pass-independent.
However, it turns out that if you have, like, some, um, like, metric,
if you were to create some random metric tensor field
and create the Riese, Riemannian curvature tensor at a given point,
then, and you were to give that to somebody,
it turns out there's generally only, um,
one choice of metric tensor at said point,
which is able to lower the contravariant index
such that the, um, first two indices
of the Riemannian curvature tensor are anti-symmetric.
Um, well, there's also a scalar multiple, um, as well.
So, uh, essentially this means that if you give someone, like,
a, um, Riemannian curvature tensor,
which was generated using a metric tensor,
then they should be able to deduce what the metric tensor was
at that exact point, um, to, uh, like, um,
they should be able to determine what the metric tensor was there
up to a scalar multiple.
So, basically, if you give someone a Levy-Savita connection field,
which was generated using a, um, metric tensor field,
they can actually reconstruct the entire metric tensor field
up to a scalar multiple.
And, uh, so, metric ambiguity is completely false
because the metric tensor is objectively not really all that ambiguous.
Like, this is the level of ambiguity that we had previously known about.
We had already known about the scalar ambiguity of the metric tensor field,
so this isn't exactly news.
Like, apparently, if you were to take a random Levy-Savita connection field,
um, which wasn't generated by a metric tensor field,
in general, the mixed index, um,
remodding curvature tensor field that it creates
is not, like, the first two, um, indices
are not going to be traceless,
so if you were to, like, contract them in the mixed index form,
it wouldn't necessarily go to zero,
which is, like, that it's supposed to
for the mixed index remodding curvature tensor.
And even if you were to create your, like,
random Levy-Savita connection field,
such that that was the case still,
then that would still not be able, like, necessarily, um,
mean that there exists a metric tensor field
which can lower the contravariant index
such that the first two indices are antisymmetric.
So, this is a property of GR
that are, like, the metric of our, like, universe or reality
is metric compatible,
which hasn't, I don't think it's actually been tested,
before.
Um, so, that might be a potentially interesting test
that you could do with, like, general relativity.
And you could actually have a Levy-Savita connection field
which is, um, re-C flat,
but not metric compatible.
So, this doesn't necessarily require
extreme densities or anything.
Um, I'm not entirely sure if we, like,
were to go out and, like, look for this,
we would really find much, like, metric incompatibility.
Um, I mean, any measurements we do
inherently have noise in them,
and that noise will, um, essentially mean
that any Levy-Savita connection field we measure
will not actually be metric compatible.
But, um, that metric incompatibility might be very small.
Though I'm not entirely sure how you would, like, calculate it.
I don't have an equation for metric incompatibility.
Um, but, regardless,
this metric incompatibility or this metric ambiguity
that, like, I had come across
had actually caused me a lot of issues,
to be completely honest,
because I had been working on, like,
my, um, dimensional collapsar theory,
which is essentially clues-to-client theory,
um, but, like, even, like,
like, to, like, an extreme, essentially.
Um, and I had, uh,
had a, like, model for, like, particles
or particle sizes, essentially.
And those depended on the size
of the compact space,
and clues-to-client theory.
And if, like, the compact space were to change size,
then so would the particles,
because, like, the dilaton, like,
uh, fields, like, got larger,
so it's, like, more space,
and therefore, like, um,
it's, it's kind of, it's sort of rooted
in, like, the fact that the, um,
metric tensor field are,
or actually, it's rooted in the fact
that, like, vacuum spacetimes
are, like, scale independent.
Um, so you can, like, scale them up or down,
and there's, like, no, um, effects, really.
So, I was going to use this to, um,
like, like, like, okay.
I should, um, start over
just, like, a little bit here.
I essentially had this model
for how dark matter worked
using, um, dimensional Clapsar theory,
where particles were our clues-to-client solitons,
and they're essentially, um,
sucking in, um, extended space-time
and expelling it in the compact space,
and this makes the dilaton feel, like,
um, elevated around particles,
um, and get, like, low,
like, smaller and smaller
with, like, greater and greater distance.
And this dilaton halo would,
I thought, would be responsible
for the effect of dark matter,
and I was going to pursue research
in this and, like, look into it more,
and metric ambiguity
kind of threw a wrench into that,
but now that metric ambiguity
is, like, dead.
Um, oh, by the way,
it was, uh, Dr. Beetle at FAU
who pointed out, like,
the error in my proof.
So, thank you, Dr. Beetle,
for, um, like, helping me, like,
figure this out.
I am eternally grateful to you.
Anyways, I should mention that earlier.
Anyways, um,
now that metric ambiguity is, like, gone,
I was able,
I decided to go back to this testing,
and I decided to calculate
what, um, the stress energy tensor was,
uh, or the 4D stress energy tensor was
for these dilaton halos.
So, what I did was,
I took the normal, um,
metric tensor for the, um,
Schwarzschild black hole.
Um, I did a wick rotation on it
such that instead of being, like, um,
time-like in the,
what is the time dimension,
it's actually space-like.
Then I added an extra time dimension,
um, and I basically relabeled
what was previously the time dimension
as the, as the dilaton field.
So, it's a compact space.
And this is a, like, type of
Kalusakine solaton,
which has zero gravitational mass.
Um, which means that
if you were to be traveling
on a purely timelike trajectory
as, like, a point particle
in the 5D space,
you wouldn't feel any, um,
attraction towards, uh, like,
it's like black hole,
or essentially, or the solaton.
But, it does have these,
this, like, dilaton halo.
And so, I went and calculated
the 4D Riesi tensor,
and I used that to then calculate
the Einstein tensor.
And it turns out that these,
that this, like, metric that I was using
for this, like, um,
Kluzakline, like, um,
like, solid, Kluzakline, um,
Schwarzschild black hole solaton thingy,
I don't know the correct name for it,
it turns out that it's a Riesi flat manifold.
So, this essentially means
that the Riesi tensor
and the Einstein tensor
are exactly the same.
And, the stress-energy tensor,
I've only calculated it
in the fully covariant, um,
like, form currently.
Um, haven't looked at it
in the, like,
contravariant form yet.
But, it appears that there's this,
um, it's, like, zero for the most part.
So, it's, like, diagonal.
There's no time, like,
component to it at all.
Um, there's only, like,
a radial, um,
theta and azimucil components.
And, the radial component
to the, um,
like, Einstein tensor,
or, I guess, like,
stress-energy tensor as well,
it's actually negative.
And, um,
the, the azimucil
and, uh, theta components
are actually positive.
And, it appears that the negative part,
like, grows weaker,
like, faster than the, um,
azimucil and theta components
as distance increases.
Um, this is just for it
in the, like, um,
fully covariant form.
Um, not entirely,
like, I think this is probably
still going to be the case
in the, um,
contravariant,
like, fully contravariant form.
But, I didn't get to that
part of the calculation
before this.
So, uh,
I'll have to make a substack post
on, like, this as well.
That and the, like,
metric ambiguity disproof.
I think that, like,
this should generate
a dark matter effect.
It seems to, like,
line up because
I, as you get, like,
farther away, like,
the, it's, like,
the metric, or
the stress energy tensor
should be, like,
mostly positive.
Um,
I'm not
entirely sure.
Um,
this, like,
is, uh,
like,
will generate
a dark matter effect,
but I'm, like,
mostly sure.
I need to do, like,
a lot more testing
on this.
So, I'm gonna be doing
more research
on this, uh,
Clues of Client Soliton
and its, um,
RECI tensor
and stress energy tensor
and see if the,
if, like,
we were to observe,
um,
something with, like,
the given stress energy tensor,
like,
out in space,
whether it would have
this dark matter effect
that we're looking for.
And if it does,
then that suggests that,
uh,
that's the testable prediction
of dimensional collapsar theory
and we should be able
to find evidence of it
in astronomical data.
So,
first prediction
of dimensional collapsar theory
and hopefully there's,
like,
evidence we can find of that.
You know,
this reminds me of something
that James Wells,
like, um,
when I posted my metric ambiguity
disproof thing
on the, like,
Wolfram Institute Discord,
like,
James, um,
said that he liked that
about, um,
my approach
because I was willing
to, um,
accept that I'm wrong
on some things
and, like,
um,
move on
and that was, like,
essentially a core element
of the scientific method.
Something along those lines.
And,
the thing is,
like,
when Dr. Beetle, like,
disproved, like,
metric ambiguity,
um,
like,
relatively quickly,
actually,
um,
and I was able to verify,
like,
his disproof,
I was very,
I wasn't, like,
upset that I had been proved wrong.
I was, like,
oh,
thank goodness
that's wrong.
That was getting,
uh,
that was causing me
a lot of issues.
So,
like,
normally when people
make, like,
their own little pet theories,
um,
they like to go
and defend them
and stuff
and, like,
they want to,
like,
keep them alive
or whatever reason
for, like,
ego-related reasons.
But,
in this case,
this was getting,
like,
technically speaking,
this was getting
in the way of, like,
things I cared more about
and it just going away
just made me, like,
very, very happy.
So,
I don't know if this is
how applicable this is
to, um,
like,
other people's research.
Thing is,
I want to be right.
I want to be correct.
I don't want to feel right.
So,
um,
not everyone's really like that,
I suppose.
those.
So,
like,
if I'm doing something
and I find a disproof
of what I'm doing,
like,
which tells me
objectively
that what I'm doing
is incorrect
and wrong,
then I won't
do it anymore.
Like,
or, like,
if a theory
gets disproven,
I'll, like,
just try to,
like,
either correct it
or I'll just
throw it out.
Um,
but I'll try
to be careful
that I'm not,
like,
throwing the baby out
with, like,
the bath water.
Like,
I'm also afraid
of doing that
because then
I'd still be wrong
and potentially
even wronger
than how I was before.
So,
I just try to,
like,
modify what I'm doing
to make myself
as correct
as possible.
One thing
I should probably do
is model
halo decay
because
if you have
these, like,
dilaton halos
which are generated
by, like,
mass distributions,
if they undergo
a, like,
strong enough
acceleration
then these
dilaton halos
should be capable
of getting dislodged
from their
generating matter
and then they should,
like,
start decaying
over time
and this is something
you should be able
to observe
with things like
the, like,
bullet cluster
or similar,
like,
structures
because there
the matter distribution,
um,
essentially collides
with itself
and two dilaton halos
then just go
flying away
without the matter
that's generating them
and then they should
be decaying
and we observe
these, um,
like,
these, like,
like,
we observe this,
like,
distribution of
dark matter,
um,
and it was, like,
out any, like,
matter around it
to, like,
I guess, like,
that's associated
with it
and we could
probably, like,
figure out how
fast these, like,
halos are traveling
and how they much
they should be, like,
decaying over time,
how big these halos
were originally
and use, like,
our, like,
data, um,
from, like,
the, like,
collisions of these,
like, bullet-like clusters
to determine
whether the, like,
prediction of halo decay
matches our observations
and,
yeah,
so,
it's a calculation
I still need to do.
Probably going to be
very interesting,
uh,
but I'd say
it's looking promising.
So,
math-wise,
I had recently
been reading
a, like,
fractal book
in Dr. Hahn's office
and it had a section
which was, like,
fractals as solutions
and
the idea was,
like,
if you were to take
something like the,
like,
the Kosh curve,
for instance,
you can use it
to make this, like,
pretty little snowflake
that's, like,
a fractal
and
essentially what it does
is it's,
you take an image
and you, like,
perform these
coordinate transformations
on it
and you sum it together
and the result
is, like,
a new image
and, like,
the Kosh curve
is essentially,
um,
the solution
to this
where,
basically,
the, like,
start and,
like,
result,
um,
are equal
and I realized
you can do this
with, like,
mathematical functions
in general.
It doesn't have to be
an image.
so I could take
a, um,
a combination of
poles and zeros
in the complex plane
and I could just
perform these, like,
coordinate transformations
on them
and I could, like,
multiply and divide
them together
and I could just
keep doing that
over and over
in an iterative process
and eventually
I should probably
get something
which looks like
this, um,
like,
Kosh curve,
um,
or Kosh curve,
whatever,
I don't know
how it's pronounced
and this should
give a way
to generate, like,
fractal, um,
functions
other than using
fractal flow
like I was before
and this can be
generalized to
L-systems in general
and I'm really
curious about
how it's going
to, like,
turn out.
I know
an aspect
of the fractal flow
which I think
exists
but can't
exactly prove
at this point
is that you can
sort of have it, like,
flow into itself
where you can, like,
have parts of the, like,
fractal, um,
meromorphic function,
like, flow around
in a closed loop
and then the function
can return to
its initial state
but it looks like
the individual components
of it have flown,
like, around.
Like, you could have,
like, a point where,
um,
the fractal is, like,
spiraling out of
and another point
where it's spiraling into
and you could probably
make an animation
of, like,
that actual,
actually happening
where the fractal
is emerging from
one point
and getting sucked
into another point.
I don't know
if you can do that
with L-Systems.
Um,
I'll have to
check it out.
Um,
I know that
L-Systems normally
are a bunch of, like,
they're made out of
a bunch of
affine transformations
and I'm wondering
if you were to add,
um,
Mobius transformations
into the mix,
um,
if that would
change anything
and you would be able
to get, like,
a similar kind of
behavior
with these, like,
um,
L-System fractals
as well.
So,
something I should
probably try doing
is creating these,
like,
L-System fractals,
um,
in higher dimensions
as well
or maybe just
sticking,
or, like,
doing some other
stuff with, like,
the one-dimensional,
um,
like,
fractals still
so they can easily
be visualized
in the complex plane
and seeing, like,
what behaviors
and properties
that they have,
um,
and how flexible
the, like,
generations of, like,
fractals are
with these approaches.
I think, um,
this should actually
be, like,
very good
for generating
dendritic fractals
because
I don't think
that this approach
should really, um,
generate fractals
which are, like,
um,
fully connected,
um,
by which I mean
you can have, like,
the Julia set,
um,
if you choose, like,
a value
for the normal one
if you choose
a value of C
which is on the edge
of the monobrot set
then,
or actually
it's on the monobrot set
exactly
then
the Julia set
which should be, like,
dendritic
and, like, um,
it should have
an area of zero
but if you
choose a point
inside of the monobrot set
um, like
and, like,
that blobby, um,
fractal thing
then
the results will,
like, the resulting
Julia set
will actually be, um,
connected
and if you were
to look at
the fractal flow of that
that would be a region
where the fractal flow
goes to complex infinity
I don't think
you can get that
with L-systems
I'm not 100% sure, though
but, um,
I'm not
I think you might
be able to get, um,
like, dust
like, can't forward dust
using, um,
a, an L-system
potentially
because I could imagine
you have, like,
a coordinate transformation
which, um,
when applied iteratively
just, like,
takes the original function
and just makes copies
of it, like,
spaced out, like,
evenly
and that would
technically, like,
be a dust
if the, like,
original, um,
field
or if the original
complex function
were to be, like,
a dust, I suppose
so
yeah
I really want to, like,
play around with that
and toy around with CID
and see if, like,
how well it works
I might
hopefully I'll, like,
sell some, like,
like,
art of this, like,
fractal stuff soon
because I imagine
it's gonna be, like,
really pretty
so, yeah
if you are, um,
good at, like,
the theory of
integral systems
then I would
probably like to
talk with you
because I'm currently
trying to learn
about them
because I'm trying
to see if I can
reformulate general
relativity
as an integral
system
and I've been
having, like,
various setbacks
and I've, like,
been learning, like,
things about
how it works
I'm trying to
figure out, like,
how many scattering
parameters, like,
a integral system
should have
if, like,
you can have, like,
multiple scattering
parameters
and if, like,
these scattering
parameters can be,
like, a tensor
like
because
a scalar field
it's kind of, like,
indistinguishable
from a, um,
like, a
one-dimensional, um,
vector
or co-vector
essentially
and
I'm not entirely
sure what the
generalization
to, like,
higher dimensional
integral systems
is
if, like,
there should be, like,
several, um,
scattering, um,
or there should be
several spectral
parameters
I meant to say
spectral parameters
before, by the way,
I'm sorry.
Like, if there should
be several
spectral parameters
or
if there should
just be, like,
um,
only one spectral
parameter
which is, like,
a scalar
I'm trying to
figure it out
I'm very confused
in this regard
so
if you're an expert
contact me, please
I don't know
what the structure
of the scattering
data is
and
I've heard
that there is
this, like,
transmission
and, like,
reflection
components to it
and I've, like,
kind of heard
that those correspond
to, like,
regions in the,
like,
positive imaginary
and negative imaginary
part of, like,
the scattering parameter
um,
like, you can imagine
the scattering parameter
as, like,
a coordinate system
and
I feel that's, like,
a weird, um,
dichotomy to have,
like, it kind of, like,
separate it in these
two parts
and I was talking
was, like,
um,
and want, like,
some AIs
to try and, like,
get a better grasp
um,
like,
the AIs
knowledgeable
knowledge on this
stuff is, like,
um,
questionable
at the very least
so I'm not taking
what they're saying,
like,
too seriously
but they mentioned
there was a way
to, like,
combine
this
such that,
um,
you have,
uh,
instead of being,
like,
wrapped
going from,
like,
negative infinity
to a positive infinity
on, like,
the real axis
you can kind of,
like,
curl it together
such that
the regions
that you're,
like,
integrating over
is,
like,
lies in,
like,
the unit circle
and the part
which was previously
the transmission
or reflection stuff
is either the region
inside that unit circle
or outside the unit circle.
I forget which.
Um,
and I'm wondering,
like,
how to solve
the inverse scattering
transform,
like,
in the general case
because I don't know
how to do that.
I don't even know
how to do it
for, like,
simpler,
like,
like,
integral systems.
Like,
there's a lot of need
to learn in this regard.
Um,
if the scattering
parameter
is a,
like,
corresponds to,
like,
a vector space,
like,
a complex vector space,
then I guess
this higher dimensional,
like,
version of,
like,
the unit circle,
um,
I guess it'd,
like,
be some complex
end torus.
Um,
so,
like,
I guess it's,
I mean,
I'm familiar with,
like,
um,
complex end torus
based on my research
on complex
Riemannian manifolds,
so,
like,
I guess I have
some familiarity there.
