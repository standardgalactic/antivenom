Toki miyan nisha. Toki pona is a conlang that's a constructed language created by Jan Sonja.
And Toki pona was built to be it's called the language of good. Toki meaning to communicate
and pona meaning good or simple or anything in that category. And it was designed to be as simple
as possible. It actually only has a vocabulary of I think 130 words in modern usage, 110 officially if
something was something like that. But the biggest thing is that all of those words are just like
Solry Sol, they're all sin sets. And so a single word will encompass just about everything with a
related meaning to it. So for instance Toki. Toki means to communicate. Toki also means language. Toki also
means hey let's start a communication. So Toki is the most common way of saying hello.
Pona like I said good, simple, easy, things like that. Anything that's related to the concept of good.
Another example is like Telo. Telo means water. But Telo also means any liquid. So Telo could mean juice.
Juice. You would say Telo sui. Sweet water. So that would be like juice. Or you could say
Telo sui. I don't know. Telo. Not sure. But Telo could probably mean blood. It could mean just about
anything with the appropriate combination of words to create what's called a noun phrase.
So the biggest sort of problem with Toki Pona in my opinion is that it's a little bit clunky. Toki Pona
has like I said a very small amount of words. So you really have to do quite a bit of combining in
order to say complex subjects. This is intentional. The point is that if you have to do so much work to
say something complicated you're going to spend that work saying something simple. If you have to do all of
this work in order to say something complicated you're going to spend that work figuring out how
to say it in as simple a way as possible. And so Toki Pona in that way really encourages us to think
about how we're communicating and how we're getting the most bang for our buck. So the biggest problem
though still in my opinion is that it's restricted but in an uncomfortable way because some words are
three syllables and when you've got 120 words I don't really see why you would need a word like
soeli meaning an animal or a land mammal where soeli is three syllables whereas it could have just been
asuela or whatever you could have figured out a way to make a hundred words in two syllables.
And that means that when you're combining words it gets clunky because you've got some words that are
longer than others. Other things that are particularly clunky in Toki Pona are for instance how you would
ask a question and the lack of plurals which they advertise as a feature not a bug but let's be
honest plurals are very useful in disambiguating. They say it's not ambiguous it's vague it can mean
both it's not like it's you have to determine which one it just means all of it at once but let's be honest
in communication knowing whether something singular and plural is a relatively important thing. Also Toki Pona
doesn't support grammatical tense an aspect which is not new like there are plenty of languages in
fact like all the Chinese languages have no grammatical tense and time is indicated with context
but it'd still be kind of useful for it to be something less clunky than for instance if I want to
say like now I am walking now I'm walking away it would be tempo ni la mi te lo right this time
then la is a word that would just say like okay we just told you some kind of connector and now let's
tell you what it is so this time so what happens I am walking so that means I'm walking now
or sorry tawa not te lo now mitawa in general actually is how you would say goodbye literally
it's I'm going I'm leaving but so it's sort of obvious in that particular context
so one of the other weird annoying things is the use of the word la so la in Toki Pona is used to
separate the subject from the predicate also has an additional use of allowing you to chain multiple
predicates so you don't use la in sentences that start with me or sina sina is you but anything else so
yan yan means person so if I want to say the person is leaving yan li yan li tawa the person
li the verb tawa to go now if I wanted to say the person is talking and leaving yan li toki li tawa I would just
use li to chain two predicates and that's all well and good but the first time it's kind of a clunky thing
so if I were to recreate Toki Pona which I am doing I am trying to add a couple little things
so first thing is my vocabulary is being restricted to one and two syllable words exclusively
and I am focusing on placing modifiers as one syllable that way they can be used to sort of constructively
create new words because what Toki Pona very deliberately does not support is the creation of additional words
now by creating everything as small modular words where they can just be said as one thing
we don't need to have so many additional syllables which of course partially contradicts the purpose of Toki Pona
in forcing us to say things simpler but also helps with getting a language that is easier to express
and easier to understand because while we do get complicated words being chained together they're
memorizable as a single thing but they're parsable as separate little one or two syllable chunks
one such example of why we would want this is for a computer so AI is really good with Toki Pona
it's like surprisingly good I mean Toki Pona has a very simple grammar tiny little vocabulary and it's
quite simple to learn and teach it and to process it they say it's like one of the only languages you can
learn an average of 30 hours in its entirety but for a computer to learn it again you can learn the grammar
and you can sort of learn it in a basic sense because the words are so generalizable you don't need quite
as much context although it does help to teach Toki Pona to a AI that already speaks a certain language
language apparently especially Chinese not entirely sure why maybe that's because Toki Pona does take
a lot grammatically from Chinese and that language families because like I said you would have like
time separately it's not grammatical it's just various other things some of the roots are also closer
to Chinese although the roots are drawn from all over the place now actually learning Toki Pona is quite
a challenge for me and I'm pretty good at languages partially because I've only been learning it for
last week but I think the challenge is trying to figure out how to memorize the connection between the
words and the writing system the writing system is known as sitelenpona there's also another writing
system called sitelen sitelen which is pretty fascinating sitelen sitelen sorry if I just go on
this for a second is not linear it's a sort of graphical writing system where you have right icons for
different words but the way you actually put them together to create a sentence is you organize them
visually instead of left to right like you would anything else sitelenpona on the other hand is
more conventional of a you know iconographic or logographic script so with sitelenpona you have a
different you know symbol for every word and since there's so few words it's relatively doable but those
symbols have nothing to do with the pronunciation whereas in sitelen sitelen the symbols are a lot closer
to the pronunciation if you well it's it's kind of close to hieroglyphics where it's really good for
describing just the language that it's written for because you do have to know what the words mean in order to see how
that connects to the pronunciation but anyways so to memorize that stuff like I said you have to know
what the words mean and even though those icons are um let's just say they're not arbitrary so knee
for instance which means this or now is like a down arrow makes makes good sense uh yan which means person
is like a circle with two little uh bars sticking the side almost looks like like a guy with his hands out
uh kulupu which means collection is a collection or group or anything that's like multiple things
together is three circles like in a triangle so if you know what the words mean then you know it's doable
but in general like there's no direct connection between the sounds and the way they're written
compared to something like korean right where korean script actually the symbols directly represent how
you pronounce them uh they're correlated to the mouth shape that you would make in order to pronounce them
it's it's pretty much an opposite ideology but you see the beauty of how korean is written
is that it's very conducive to chunking so there's like the famous example that everyone knows which is
when you see like the word the and of you don't actually read them um there's i can't remember exactly
what it says uh but it's like did you read the the words in this correctly or something like that where
most people don't recognize that it said the twice
what this is showing us is that when we read text we're not reading the letters but rather we're reading
the ideas and we're reading the shapes as chunks single chunks uh there's also the classic example where
you can read some text where all of the letters are jumbled around except for the ascenders and
descenders and the first and last letter and with just the first last letter and the ascenders and
descenders people can read pretty fluently which is why it's beyond me how anyone myself included can read
like uh russian cursive script i mean all the letters look the same m t n u e they like they all look
exactly the same but somehow it's legible because we chunk because we don't try to parse where a letter
starts and stops right we just parse a general shape it's like we have this many lines close together
this many lines farther apart and with the way that korean writing puts a syllable into a single character
you can parse it as separate letters but you can also just recognize the symbol and say the sound
this is a sort of happy happy medium it's not quite a syllabary like say the cherokee language uses
uh by the way fascinating how uh sequoia's syllabary is uh it uses shapes from other languages like it uses
like a w and an n shape and a k shape but they have absolutely nothing to do with the actual like way
that they're pronounced in latin and some of the shapes are completely unrelated and that's because
it's sort of independently developed probably the uh maybe one of the only completely independently
developed uh syllabaries or writing alphabet systems of any kind because it really has no basis in anything
uh so again like those where you have a direct connection to pronunciation on a syllable level
however in cherokee your words have a lot more syllables so you don't have as short things and
you're still at the end of the day chunking at least that's the perception i get i'm not fluent in
cherokee i've studied a little bit only from a linguistics perspective so how can you memorize such
things it's kind of an interesting subject memory all together because it's both very studied and also
not well understood for instance there's a scientific concept uh consensus that photo memory doesn't exist
which i can just personally say is both i don't know if we have to bleep that word out because i have
one my friends have them uh so i don't understand how we can have a scientific consensus that things that
we know from our own experience don't exist but different people do use different strategies to memorize
for me i have sort of three different ways that i remember things there are some things that i
remember pretty much involuntarily and those are like photo memories then i can remember sounds
um i'm not sure if the fact that i've been playing music for essentially since the moment i could speak
uh was a um helper to the fact that i can really easily memorize sounds or if it was actually the
other way around um definitely see a connection but correlation does not imply causation right um
you do have a relationship in between the uh way that we represent things in sound and the way that
we represent them in memory when it comes to remembering sequences see visual and spatial memory
doesn't have the same element of sequencing but memorizing sounds you can't sort of randomly access
them at least in my experience so one trick that i've used every once in a while to like memorize
something for an exam that's purely rote memorization is it's like i've got 40 terms i'm going to turn the
entire thing into a i have a monologue or a song or something like that using just regular text memorize
the sound and every single question go through the entire thing and it works right you're able to store
that memory because when you remember things that are a sequence you're essentially remembering
it's kind of like a linked list right you can't store the entire thing at once but if you look at
how a computer will store a linked list it's like the element has right it's two things it's the current
value and then a link to where to find the next thing or a link to where to find the previous thing it
doesn't really matter if you call a previous or next but in that way when we're remembering
sort of a long sequence if we're remembering a song if we're remembering a script or something like
that the last line as we go through that last line going through the last line is part of the trigger
to remember the next one and that allows efficient sequential memorization and sequential recall
it does not on the other hand allow for efficient random access so if you want to randomly access
a fact you have to go through the entire memory sequentially until you hit it because there isn't
say a lookup table visual memories you typically recall them sort of in their entirety when you bring
them up and so if you put things spatially in your visual memory or if you put them just like in
a picture you can then look at the specific part of the picture and it has more of a tree-like structure
now that tree-like structure is a lot more useful for drawing connections but perhaps this is a problem
with how we test and certainly we have this more with certain courses than others
that biology courses are a nightmare with that and certainly plenty of courses in law or even
liberal arts are very focused on memorizing definitions and memorizing things that we can sequentially store
where we have the capability of sequentially recalling them it leads to us not learning because in order
to learn things we have to draw those connections right we have to chunk them we have to have hey i
have this reference and it connects to these other things having it only connects to the thing that was
last in the sequence allows us to recall it and it allows us to use it if it's just information that
needs to be stored for like long-term retrieval if you're good at that kind of long-term memory i'm
pretty decent at it but certainly a lot of people aren't also by the way this works really well with
short-term because one thing that you can do is you can keep repeating it to yourself and remember
how to get back to the end of the list right because it's sort of a pattern where the actual
pattern that triggers the recall is the way that it's said rather than what it means
but this isn't giving you any ability to draw connections except to the extent that you can say
hey i've got a pointer to this list and i know that this list has something related to this and if i
go through the entire list i will at some point find something that then has a relationship to the
question i'm trying to ask it's actually there's a strong connection with this with the way that we
have memories in say llms and vector databases and things like that so big problem that i have with rag
i know this is like way off where we started but rag is retrieval augmented generation it's a technique
used with large language models in order to be able to augment the generated output that's what we say
although what we actually mean is augment the input with a related series of facts that are drawn from a
database so that we have in the context to be drawn upon an actual grounded answer the problem with that is how we
actually do it and we do it in a way that's somewhat similar to how we do these things in our mind
where we have the input and some augmented variations we then generate some additional sort of augmented query
then we just go into the memory bank and find things that are similar and add the most similar things
into the context right we take things out that match our sort of embedding of our current world view
we then retrieve the things that match it from our memory put them in our short-term memory if you will
of our context and then continue generating and that works pretty well but also you're not going to find
typically similar things in your database to your prompt if you actually want to memorize like a lot of facts
an alternative technique is to go through and my colleagues actually built a system
that is that goes through this as an experiment which is we go through every single piece
in a list in order and say hey okay this is the list let's say a is it related is it something we need
no then go to b is it what we need nope go to c yes okay keep that do we want to keep going okay go to d
go to e go to f keep f right we go through every single thing in the list we're the only thing
now that we're remembering is the next item in the list and the true solution is a hybrid it's to have
an index building that index and being able to support both of those types of memory is really the key
to being able to have some sort of functional intelligence a lot of this memorization can occur
through sleep anything sequential in general like to the best of our knowledge memory is based on
that associations right it is like those um like the rag where we have embeddings and we just find
things that are closest to the embeddings and they come up right another way of actually looking at it is
there's resonance and um we would have if we send a certain frequency into a chamber that frequency is
going to be louder in some places than others due to interference with the walls and this is in
general always going to be the case um and certain chambers will have more of a different response to
different frequencies than others so having sort of a sufficient shaped chamber where you can find the
loudest areas allows us to actually store information in those boundaries right where we can say hey this is
loud here now what's loudest here where else is that loud right that allows us to draw a connection
so the best of our knowledge with research that's how all memory is it's all based on this
but like i said by looking at these lists as ordered pairs where the relation between item a and item b is
that item b comes after item a so the fact that they are paired right so many times in sequence means that
they will be recalled together after you recall a you will recall b and that way i don't have to store
the entire chain right i don't have to store d in there because once i bring b up b will bring c up and
once i bring c up c will bring d up because there's sort of like a chain of relations even though a and d
you aren't that closely related and wouldn't come up so building out the index tree where you would
have the groups and building out the sequences where you would be able to say hey i have a recollection
between the head of this sequence or a head of this sequence there's ways of doing it where you'd have
like an index into part of the sequence is going to allow us to most efficiently store and retrieve
memories without too much work beauty is recalling a sequence right if it's based on the old adage
you know once the fire together wire together is that you don't have to understand everything in the
sequence in order to memorize the sequence right you can just play it as you go to sleep play the sounds
look at the pictures right put yourself in a complete daze and you will still have that link because
again you will have first second second third go go go go and if you're hearing it if you're seeing it
you will build the link and you will have that connection without you ever having to do anything
to learn it and then all you have to do in order to use that knowledge is to recall it in order
now the other kinds of memories where we're actually trying to build a memory that draws a direct
connection where we can directly match the pattern and get to the answer
for those we actually have to do that by practice
and so you have to have some degree of drills or quizzing or things like that or just real world
experience now that can be done in a dream that can be done through a game that can even be done
inadvertently if you're really clever about how you set it up but it can't be done sort of
passively in the same way that memorizing a sequence can be done
so it requires a certain level of interactivity that takes time when we're trying to memorize
something passively we can do it in the background we don't have to put any kind of attention or focus
to it so finding the right balance is probably pretty important in figuring out how to maximize our
cognitive ability
