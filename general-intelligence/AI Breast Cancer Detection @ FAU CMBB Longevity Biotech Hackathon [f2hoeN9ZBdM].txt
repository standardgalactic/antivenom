about a little bit about how maybe not necessarily a story but it's all of our stories we all know
somebody that has had breast cancer or has had to fight it um i think that when it comes to
having that moment where you're diagnosed it's you're starting the fight and it's become that
fight where maybe we can change the idea and maybe we can plant a seed of a cultural change where
instead of being diagnosed we can be proactive and we can you know highlight those biomarkers for maybe
ancestral things we can you know change the way we look at maybe that approach of getting
early on detection because of the rise in ai and the compute power that we have at our hands that
we have the ability to really help people and keep track of really important biomarkers
um so within this talk i really want to plant the seed and maybe start a new story for all of us
that we can you know take better cares of ourselves because of the power that we have now been afforded
so with ai we plan on using ai to help to supplement and to really augment the support for breast cancer
awareness along with the care of it first and foremost what ai would do is to help with hospitals
and clinics with the reduction of radiologists workload along with the margin for human error
one of the main things that happens within business as well as production is i'd say just
the margin for human error a lot of people they make mistakes from here and there people working
long nights overnights i know a long i know a lot of us did and this leads to certain things happening
whether it being error people messing up or just missing things entirely if you were to have another
helper with you that being ai then this would support your business a lot along with this i'll talk about
the decreased healthcare spending through early treatment
another thing with ai is that it would help to identify early signs of cancer within people one
thing a lot of people don't know within breast cancer awareness is that people aren't just getting
breast cancer once they sighted at age 40 and older ages people as young as eight and even 14 can get
breast cancer as cited in one of our sites from an eight-year-old girl in utah so what we did was we
use the cnn and we um we gave it some real world medical imaging from the mnist data set so we gave
it some breast cancer tissue images from an ultrasound and what we did to the images is we did some data
augmentation uh weight loss functions uh leaky relu activation dropouts and learning rate scheduling and
early stopping and with this next slide next slide so with this we got a 92 accuracy level which is
extremely high uh and this is only with 200 epochs and with um some regular laptops uh nothing special
no special gpus uh and you see we got a 93 AUC area under the curve and 100 training accuracy which is
common with training um yeah and so this is our team so my name is ayan and we have dennis and christopher
so i was a team lead and i'm the main data scientist uh and dennis is the machine learning ai specialist
so me and him both focus on the creating the code uh and doing the main research for the data
data and christopher and i did some uh research and we found a data set for the breast uh breast images yeah
so what would be the next step step for you to actually have a complete trial of the solution
that you produce um i think um similar to what fau is doing like creating that very public and uh
available source for biomarkers and maybe like partnering with like john hopkins to then take
their patients and put them through those kinds of you know with their trials like collect that
data and create those personal profiles that then we can track you know early on in life i think is
a big advantage and it could be the proof of concept that any that you know more hospitals could use
the main thing with early detection is that when you detect cancer early it's much easier to fight
against it and it's also much cheaper to fight uh cancer early on so a big thing with this is people
would say it's very expensive to take ultrasounds at an early age but it's if you take um even 30
ultrasounds from the age of 20 to 50 it's much cheaper than treating uh cancer late and treating uh taking
30 ultrasounds and doing early detection and early treatment
any other questions i'm good thank you
