please let's give it up for Dr. Hazan thank you so much for presenting thank you Eddie
so as you know my name is Hanan El-Hazan and I'm from the Allen Discovery Center in
Tuft University I would like to talk to you about two
oh my computer's stuck that's fun I would like to talk to you about two different possibilities
that you can use biology in in our environment today that I think are well deserve
more attention and more people working on them so the first is that as you can know
already the computational growth of very variation algorithms like chat GPT
large language models diffusion models all of those programs require huge amount of computational
resources and without computational resources also demands for electricity and resources which is
tremendously can overwhelm our infrastructure which we should somehow going to hopefully develop in
biology another another field as as Dr. Field just talked about is a medical intervention using
techniques that come from engineering the levin lab show amazing results using models that can be
manipulate and sometime even treat
some biological problems that we currently have so let's start with the computational resources we know if
you plot and I know that it's a already by now in the computational field this is an old
diagram we can see that the growth of the computational resources needed today is exponentially growing every
year we are doubling the needs of our algorithms and every year we are as sequences we need more computational
power that need more electricity that need more resources every things in that chain require more and more
process but there is some limitation that we can grow on for example the shrinking size of the
silicon chip there is some limitation that we eventually going to reach it the electricity demand that we will
need in order to get to get to that computational resources will eventually reach so what can we do and one option is to look no less than biology
the rat brain take very very small amount of computational resources it's about 0.04 watt
but our brain require about 20 watts and compared to that a very old algorithm by now alpha zero require 3000 watts and i'm not talking about even chat gpt and all of those algorithms that are
are really really really in demand so in a way we can look for the computational point of view in biology cells
so even if we are talking about the computers today or the neural network of today the neural network of today are
our our our reminiscence or the predecessors of the models that start in the 1957 in the cold pressotron well
that algorithm was a discrete as as is today we didn't change much uh the only way that we change is that growing
one not one perceptron a large language model contain billion of parameters which mean millions of neurons
that connect between them and that kind of algorithm is very different of what biology use biology use
and in cells in neurons they use an analog and the complication or the on the complexity of organism
one simple cell is very very much com very complicated compared to what we use to describe a neuron
this is an illustration of a neuron as to claim that this neuron is resembling to the human brain is
probably similar to claiming that homer simpson is a representation of humor a human body so just
give you some illustration this is how neurons look like under the microscope this is how they operate
and they're flashing they're doing their activity is about a flash or not flash or spike or not spike and
this is very appealing to computer science that are operating in binary world but not like a computers or
algorithm in the deep learning the neurons under the microscope you can see them growing and try to
reconnect to other neurons and the neighbors so in a way they try to change their algorithms and change
the architecture and they growing or manipulating the way that they transmitting information throughout the
the tissue a little bit more complicated than that this is a cortex of a rat brain under the microscope
that being manipulated with some monitors proteins that give him different colors so what you can see here
the yellowish and the yellowish object that you see running around here is some cells that call glia
and the and astrocytes and astrocytes are moving cells you can see them running away they are usually
considered to be cleaning the leftover and stuff that are left from activity of neurons and the green neurons
are the excitatory neurons and the red neurons and inhibitory neurons which is really really complicated
compared to our simplified version of of neurons but in a way we can use them in order to understand
how also human brain work or nervous system work and try to use them as a computational
devices that can help us to process much more information in the future how can we do something like
that we use something called mea multi electrode arrays and those are the the cells that you can the petri dish
here that you can see here and there are cells inside and this is how they look like under microscope
you can see the cells around here and those are dots are electrodes that are sensing the information
and or the activity and also manipulating and stimulating the activity so in this way we can transmit information to the tissue
and encode the environment and encode the environment and to see how they react so a team of my old
laboratory and the technion used this already in 28 in 2008
and to use a robot that send in sensors to a petri dish of cortical neurons and that cortical neurons
had a decision to make how to avoid and and go forward and avoiding obstacles on on the platform
and that wasn't as simple but very very rewarding because you can do that with less than 10 neurons
on the petri dish which is amazing compared to the vast of computational resources that you would need to do
in order to create an algorithm that will solve it so since your bioelectricities or biohackathon
i don't want you currently now using a biology to work on your on on your project but one of the options is to do a simulation
simulation one of the simulation that we have is is bindsnet that use the information like an atari game
and try to connect it to a spiky neural network in order to manipulate then control the algorithm in the
environment and this is an example how we use a spiky neural network to play a ping pong game
which at that case was very much successful compared to the artificial neural network that being trained
in the similar way but was less successful so if you want to try this is one of the environment that
that we we use in our simulation let's jump ahead and and to the medical point of view and not only the
computational power and this is will be the second subject and in the computational in the medical point
of view you know or in the biological point of view as as a computer scientist i'm seeing pearls are very
very interesting creatures in a way each cell start from the same ancestor they all start from one
sperm cell that being divided and and modulate and still divided and clone so it means that every cells in
your body and our body contain the same instruction set in computer science we will call it the same
programming but each one of those cells are differentiate and specialize to a different
method some of the cells become skin cells some of the cells become liver cells and each one of them
operate on their environment and this is something very very interesting to work on because what kind of
information or what kind of program you can create in order to
is to take in take in account all of these complexities that we have in the human brain or human body or in every
creature that you have so again let's start with some simulation we can simulate each cells in a series of
of capacitors resistance and inductors and in a way we can create a simulation of how biology biological tissue
look like or will behave in a certain conditions and for that we had we build a another simulator that called
betsy simulator a biological inspired a electric tissue simulator and alexis one of the members in the lab
use this simulator to do something that i think it's amazing in terms of of a way of manipulating biology
and they had experiment and they had experiment and in this experiment uh they use a a frog
uh all sites and you can see it here in the screen and you can see the face of that frog in that moment so in
this development point you see this is this is from the beginning this development point the tissue in the
embryo being divided into two parts and this part is the cleavage where it's been decided
what cells going left and what cells going right and once that happen the brain of the tadpole being
developed and this is a normal normal tadpole nothing happened to it it's fine normal however
if doing this this growth you expose that the tadpole to a nicotine what we'll see is that the control
develop a normal brain but the tadpole that being that exposed to nicotine did not develop a normal
brain and in that's a in that in that way that tadpole was very defected did not survive and died very
easily so the question is how can we manipulate the the development of the cells even if the tadpole
being exposed to nicotine how can we counteract the effect so pi one of the senior members in the lab
measure the activity and the voltage of each one of the cells around the face of the embryo and discover
that there is sort of a cleavage in the control in the in the normal frog cells that have that kind of
cleavage that we can see it here and that cleavage is being exposed in the level of voltage in the cells
in that area here and once the nicotine bin is in the system and that tadpole exists with the nicotine
that cleavage were not being developed in strong enough in order to must create the right division
but the question was how to find the right drug in order to manipulate this or to counteract this kind
of effect and alexis tried to simulate everything in the simulation in betsy and after a lot of experiments
where she did a very manual job in order to find the right compound in that compound we abbreviated in
high tea here which being introduced after the exposure to nicotine and those tadpoles succeed to
create the right cleavage and the the brain of the of the tadpole when form pretty normally so in the way
to create that kind of of to find this intervention we're and we're able only because we have the
simulation to do that because once we have the simulation it's very easy to restart the experiment
and start it in different condition it's very hard to do that in biology every one of those experiments
you need to grow the the tadpole from scratch wait about three months until it grow until it
uh exposed and until you can get a reading from it so to do experiments while one trial will take you
three months will be enormous overtake and there will where simulation can take over by creating the
condition and running many many many simulation because we have computer powers in order to find the
right agent the right agent the right intervention to um to have that kind of uh correction so
in in my work i'm using the same simulation and i'm trying to take the simpler way of parameters in order to
find a um a program or a pipeline where a biologist can come to me and say i would like to create this
kind of a pattern what am i need to do in order to create this kind of pattern what kind of intervention
i need to use in order to create a pattern so i started with a simple solution with a simple tissue
where i have roughly six parameters with each one of the ranging range values and you can easily see
that once you add more and more parameters the combinatorical space of the possibilities are
growing exponentially so in a way to do that kind of search we need more sophisticated tool beside just
randomly pick a parameter and hope for the best um in a way we can look at the parameter space and this
is only illusion where we are somewhere in this parameter space and we want to achieve this target
and in order to not go in a random search we need a way to understand the parameter space
in order to find our way directly to the target and that's where come a heuristic algorithm
heuristic algorithm are have many flavors or many ways some of them can and the one that are we are
very uh fun of them is a genetic algorithm which is a very easy and simple algorithm but it's really rely
on a lot of guessing and and randomness so in our in in the levin lab we develop a a deep learning
based on diffusion reaction the diffusion model similar to the models that are exist in the in creating our
our um images on um on the platform like open ai where we have the parameter space uh
the a bin explore using the algorithm and the algorithm able to predict where the right coordination of the target is located
and we compare this algorithm to the regular uh um genetic algorithm which you can see here
in our algorithm we are able to have multiple targets and in the genetic algorithm is less way of
finding multiple targets we also have able to changing on the fly meaning if the environment change
the the algorithm itself learn and adapt to the new situation which which the regular heuristic
algorithm that used today is not able to adapt in this case the target is find the green and the
genetic algorithm is not able to find the green after it gone and change direction and another thing
that we can do is manipulate the search in a way that we can say in a way of reinforcement learning
we can manipulate the search to say we would like for example that the lunar lender that just landing here
will not activate his trust trust so much why because we need to consume energy
energy and this is very hard to do in a regular uh genetic algorithm in our algorithm it's much much faster and
able to sustain a adaptation to a condition that we forcing on so let's go back to the
the frog phase we would like to find a parameter that once we start with a regular tissue the regular tissue
will converge eventually to seem to be similar to our control or to our target which is the control
phase the work phase with the clevelage here and this is one of the parameters that we found in
our search which you what you see here in our search which you what you see here you see about 600 cells
each one of them behave as a regular cells in the in in the fog that have the same ion channels the same
gap junction the same conductances and we just need to find the right parameters in order to initiate
the the activity so in in a way we're getting to the same pattern as we wanted from from the beginning
and this is one of the results that we came up with and in another way of a cell that have a
different voltage activity or voltage dynamic in different tissue another an example that we have
is if for example the the biologist would like to say i would like to have a a cells that eventually
will create a smiley face so this is our target and we let the algorithm to find the right parameter
that will end up as a smiley and eventually after a long experiments
we find the right combination where we should how we should use our how
what kind of concentration of ion channels concentration or drugs manipulation
we need in order to manipulate the tissue to reach to the desire
target like this one is the um
the the the smiley another question that we ask again because we are so so much computer scientists
is there a way to find a combination that is not effect uh because of shape or a um or number of tissue
and apparently it was very hard decision or hard search but we did find a way to
uh find an intervention that can work in many many combination of cells that are a um in a different
combination of arranging of cells number of cells or or the shape of the cells
another option that we have is a tissue that we sustain a memory meaning we stimulated here at the
beginning we have it a stimulate where is my mouse
uh yeah in this uh uh in this figure in the right figure you can see the stimulation begin and then
the activity of all of the voltage activity of all of the tissue sustain and a higher voltage
uh another option that we had if you know the game of life by conrey going of life so this is one of the
games that we create or glider and we can find the same sort of combination in a tissue that creates
the game of life in that um in that tissue another another another method or parameter that we want to achieve is um
achieve a similar to linear another simulation that we run they have a simulation of creatures that create
a mathematical creature we want to achieve similar way and in um in our tissue and again we ran the
parameters a search to sign to find the right parameters and that's what it comes with and some
interesting um shapes that you can see
or cardiac cells and this is one of the experiments that create cells that are fluctuating and operating
like clocks so they're oscillating again this is something unique in those simulation which you can see
there are about 1200 cells in those tissue which each one of those cells contain the same algorithm and the
same configuration of any other cells in the system but as you can see as a combination of them as a
dynamic activity we can get a different activation patterns which is what we can see in biology in
uh um in biology uh scenario um and the last uh the last uh um example is symmetry and a symmetry breaking
which you can see that uh the same cells the same tissue create this symmetry activity almost copy of the
uh left and right uh left and right tissue or left and right tissue again creating a dynamic activity in
that tissue is very hard to predict in a both in computational and in biological uh scenario and with that uh
i would like to thank you for your attention and thank you for my collaborators
awesome i'm gonna assume there are maybe a couple of questions so regarding the first half of the
presentation um how is that related to what elon musk is doing with neural link this is very related uh
what elon musk doing uh is intervention inside the brain already which is different than simulation because
in simulation the situation is very hard in when you use biology is is 10 times or thousand times
harder than regular regular cells but in a way the simulation can help this kind of experiment like what
neural link doing uh to predict where to uh stimulate how to stimulate because you remember when they do the
experiment on human brain you don't have a second trial it's a human brain that we are talking we don't
want to guess and test on uh on a human so before you do something on human you should do that
that first of all on on simulation um what are the underlying assumptions of your uh simulated models
that's a good question um every simulation have a reduction doing some kind of reduction
simulation every simulation uh create a simplified way of a starting point uh um uh ion channels and
many other simulations so the simulation can be only good as the data we created that's the reason we are
working with a lot of biologists in order to be near where the ground the truth ground exists so we try to
simulate as much as what we need from biologies and not also bug down the level of complexity
that the computer can do for example when you do a simulation how low you can go in the way of
simulating how low you can you would like to simulate would you like to simulate the atom level the
molecules the ion channels interaction each one of those are different questions that we need to ask
ourselves and depend on the target of the of the the aim of the research we find the golden block where the
where we need more less compromise on parameters so to your answer depend on your depend on the task
all right um at some point at the beginning you were saying uh like um a good idea would be to have
a spiking neural network to play a game and yes if you see an advantage of doing that instead of
persecution neural networks and my second question is do you feel that adding more physical properties
like ionic permanence or snap would you have for a test like that also a wonderful question so um
the reason i'm i love spiking neural network is because although it's hard to simulate them and you
need a lot of computational resources to simulate them in electronics it's very easy to use to use spiking
neurons there is many uh materials today that are cheap reliable and cost effective to create
neurons or spiking neurons in electronics and while once you use that kind of electronics in order to
simulate a chat gpt on the same computational resource or the same size of network
the spiking neural network will take less than 10 percent of the computational or the electricity
resources that the artificial neural network will use today so the reason is to use spiking is not only
economic ecological or or cost effective is also once you we succeeded to establish how to learn in um
using spiking neural network we would able to really leap jump really a huge jump to a environment where the
computational resources are at least thousand times stronger than what we can do with the same with the
same electricity demand thank you dr azan i was actually going to ask if you don't mind giving a
couple words of inspiration or motivation as people are trying to lock down on their ideas for the night
because they do have to submit this tomorrow and you know we have a mix of people in biology computer science
engineering some math and physics people i believe so if there was anything you could kind of say that
would really get them thinking out of the box such as yourself are there anything that sort of come to mind
ignore whatever other people say to you that it's not possible do that does that does that include
me and you especially me and you perfect all right last round no more questions michael
michael so i just thought of a new neural network or i don't know if it's a new neural network um
during your talk what about one where like a neuron is able to look at um a bunch of neurons from
previously and i find that list in them and there's a weighted sum of them and um depending on the
result and it all has gotten with is the binary option would that be more similar to like the um
the model of neurons in the brain it's a it's very similar to the way that neuron working in the brain
but in the way that also neuron working in the brain are um one caveat that i i didn't show here in
this presentation that our brain doesn't use back propagation algorithm which is the main engine
beyond all of the models that have been used today in artificial neural network there are many many
requirements or constraints that biology have that back propagation algorithm is not able to
work in those constraints so the big question is how new you want learn how new you want adapt what
what is nature come with genes and one is nature we learn coming from learning the environment and that's
where i'll need you to think about new ideas awesome thank you give it up for dr razan
so with that uh we just thank you so much um for your time and uh for a very fascinating topic so have
a great evening we're gonna sign off the zoom and get down to business thank you good luck
