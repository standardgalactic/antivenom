i quickly wanted to give an overview about the augmentation lab and what it is
because i think a lot of these shared passions are also what drives us and i know some people
i think should know this already but as an augmentation number community of what i'm
going to explain in a second philosopher builders and we're driven by curiosity about how we can
augment the human condition so maybe an overview today we kind of see a cambrian explosion of
technologies that enable us to enhance and explore the way that we live as humans and what that even
means so we see advancements that are really rapidly accelerating in gen ai and biosensors
blockchain longevity robotics you name it space at the same time we're seeing an evolution or a
democrat in democratization of access to these tools we have increased technological digital
capabilities in our people we have more access to computing and the internet and we have more
people who build open source hardware know how to use it and we have movements for digital
fabrications with 3d printing and other techniques with things like fab labs so what we believe this
century is really all about or this movement or period that we're in is we think it's an augmentation
revolution people talk about the ai revolution but we really think that the whole point of what we're
seeing right now is we become able to augment ourselves in ways that were not possible before
at all and that's going to change a lot of the fabric the social fabric of how we interact and what
we really become as a species so we think everything has always been but at this point at a rapid scale
is being augmented with technology whether it is our ability to live longer to produce more consume more
kill more kill more share more surveil more a lot more so we ask besides the interest of wanting to augment
to what end what should we really augment towards we discuss even in these discussions on longevity and
cognition what do we really want out of this would we want to live forever is that really something
that's desired there are some of these questions that we think are important to make to think about
deeply and make personal decisions about as we are building and exploring what what's really possible
just because something's possible should it be done that's kind of part of it so yes we come at
the idea of the philosopher builder in the past uh in the ancient times just make philosopher kings that
were able to decide make decisions yield most of the power now we think it's the technologists that
yield most of the power and we think they should also be philosophers who are able to reason wisely
with that power so our mission as the augmentation lab is to build a community of philosopher builders to
kind of clarify and explore what our ideal future with technology means um together with purpose-driven
people who are motivated by such goals and wisdom the seeking of wisdom as well as wanting to build
with intelligence so yeah at least and i think it's we think it's very transdisciplinary what that even
means i don't have my t-shirt on today but we generally say we're techno activists optimists skeptics
capitalists spiritualists communists everything is welcome in that discussion because we really need to
keep a very open mind when discussing these deep and crucial topics so yes just very quickly almost
done our work we do a few things so we have a working group on sustainable technology goals
where we do discuss these topics and also write about them in op-eds we host annual summer residencies
where we bring in builders together to build and we also have working groups around r&d topics
and this is what i really want to get to as well and we also have a house now um that we want to
have a space for philosophy but this is in cambridge we have a discord community that's global so if you
check out our website you'll find it um i want to connect with people but we're looking for a fourth
roommate so if you if you want to live here um with us it's a beautiful house it shows enough
um we want to make this a place where we can have salons with discussions um but also small hackathons
with people um to explore these things so yes if you're interested there's a qr code also on the door
and the other thing is we're also actually hosting a longevity special um the day before the start of
the conference um on halloween it's with foresight institute and longevity biotech as a csc that's
five minutes away so if you have time or technically i think almost a capacity or even over uh so you might
get out of the way this is something but definitely check it out um and that as well thank you so much
