Hey, I'm Sresht and I just wanted to say a few things about Ecolapta's Cognitive Hackathon.
It's so cool that they set up a place where you could just work on your ideas and really form them and, you know, explore them rather than just going all in on a project just to woo some judge into giving you a prize.
I think the level of understanding and just deep creative thought that was there in the room at the hackathon was amazing and that was what drew me to it in all honesty.
I had a lot of fun. The people who were selected for the hackathon was great and I generally think that the collection of people who were brought in the room were so absolutely talented and hardworking that it was impossible to have a bad experience there.
So I got to build a really cool project called Shuffler, which is up on GitHub. It's SHFLA and it's a Turing-complete language composed of music and fractals and that's not a very utilitarian project and that's what I think was great about the hackathon because despite it not being, you know, something you could ship out to users and get feedback on immediately,
it's something which redesigned a system of thought specifically around how language is perceived. Can you think in terms of just visuals? That's what I was trying to explore here.
And yeah, hackathons are great, but I think this is a different type of event and that's in a good way. So yeah, it unlocked a whole different way of thinking for me and I've been using it ever since.
I try and look at things from a sort of different perspective, one with a little more taste to it rather than just, you know, more abstract, removed ways of thinking.
So yeah, ever since I've been doing that, I've realized what made the hackathon great was the people for sure. And I think they always bring along amazing people for these events.
So yeah, I hope to see you there. And yeah, keep hacking.
