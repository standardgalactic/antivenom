imagine a donut like the surface of a donut like that is a um two taurus if you have a two taurus
imagine you want to like flatten it onto like a plane or whatnot so you like can embed it in
like two dimensions instead of like three dimensions that is not really possible to do
in real dimensions um but if you're moving to complex coordinates then what you can easily
do this by producting two complex one spheres together you could imagine that this complex
two taurus is actually a um the cross-sectional topology of a two taurus um wormhole if you were
to have this it would essentially be um a reesey flat manifold which means it does not require any
like exotic energy or whatnot to stabilize it you could have two sphere wormhole mouse over here and
a two sphere wormhole mouse over here connecting these like going through like complex coordinates
is this like um like complex um two taurus wormhole could be like embedded like what was in like the
coordinate system such that um you could um go from here and go through like these complex coordinates
and come back out at another like point in space from your perspective you didn't go like that like
far but from like the perspective of someone who's unaware of the wormhole you could move like a vast
amount of distance
you
