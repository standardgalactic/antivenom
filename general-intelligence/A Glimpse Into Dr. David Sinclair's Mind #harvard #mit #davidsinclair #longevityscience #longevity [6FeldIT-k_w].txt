you'll probably get a better insight into my brain than ever before.
So this is an old yeast cell.
I took a picture of it when I was in my 20s.
I was working with Lenny Garanti, who I owe a lot to my professor at MIT.
And this is an old yeast cell.
And what Lenny and I co-published in Cell in 1997,
two major things happened for yeast aging.
One was it seems to be somewhat of a program in that there's a stochastic element
where you get genomic instability, the DNA breaks,
you get a circle formed of ribosomal DNA.
But after that, now it's a very predictable program.
We could mathematically model and predict the lifespan of yeast cells and their offspring.
And all that math is actually buried in the back of that paper.
The genomic instability in this organism led to the distraction of gene regulatory factors,
and it was messing up the epigenome.
And that gave rise to the phenotypes of aging, not just the death,
but the phenotypes or the characteristics of aging in yeast are similar to us.
They get old, they get slow, they get large, as you can see with this yellow.
