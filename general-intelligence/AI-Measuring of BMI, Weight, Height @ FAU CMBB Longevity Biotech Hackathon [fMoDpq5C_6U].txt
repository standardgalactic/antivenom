hi everyone my name is vivek sonar and i'm a researcher
research assistant uh in and in medical uh imaging only
so yeah uh so what we are doing here like the many individuals
like the including the elderly patient with the they have like some diseases
right so osteoporosis like arthritis the
sarcopenia the balance disorder so as well as the the
accident victims and the post-surgery patients so
they are recovering from the spinal injuries also you know so
they have the hip fractures the knee replacement and the haze
like the face significant challenges also so additionally
individual with a neurological like neurological condition also
so that the disabilities such as a parkinson disease
multiple sclerosis the als and the another type of the disease we have
and the you know the most important is a faulty and the chronic illness
also so we are not unable to stand on the traditional weighing scale on the
rooting health assessment so that is the main factor okay so we
have like like traditional factor we have
uh for example just weighing machine and we are just standing on the weighing
machine right now and then we are scaling the weight and the
height and the body volume so what we are doing exactly
so here if we go to here like we have like who faces this problem
final for example spinal cord injury is the stroke survivor you can see the
arthritis parkinson paper the the diseases faulty and these diseases we
have so they can't stand on the weighing machine so this is very
important factor and and for the weighing machine
so what we can do for the drug delivery and for the doses
so weighing is very very important you know the boss mass body volume
and the weight and the height so this is very important for us
so you know the balance disorder so we have a lot of injuries so how can we
increase the health span and the aging of these people and the normal people
also so we have the solution like challenges so yeah
the not possible for the injured people's elderly patient the
frequent hospital visits because of the time consuming expensive and that's
stressful even not accessible for the home-based care also so what we are
doing here so you can see the solution so we are
doing ai power 3d body analysis so here non-contact ai driven weight body
volume and the height estimation using a single 3d camera
so you can go and just uh can you please go there
so this is our single 3d camera and if we go here
so you can see this is our body you can just turn it out here
yeah so see we can detect the patient image like this one
so this is the real sense camera and this is the intel real sense camera so with
this help of this camera we are detecting the weight so how it works like
this is the ai 3d camera and with the help of the some ai like the estimate
the height weight and the mass distribution
so this is so this is our camera you know the 3d camera in the patient
so we can uh system in the 3d camera uh in the hospital in the home anywhere we
can fit into that one this is the flowchart of this one
and this is me so what we are doing this is the actual picture so this is the
real-time picture this is the me this is we are segmenting the body this is the
body part segmentation the color segmentation
and the my age you can see estimated weight is a 70.94 this is the exactly
weight we are finding by the ai system only
okay so this is very important so you can see the total body volume 0.073
okay and this is the technical part so this is the 2d image so we converted 2d
image to the 3d image that is possible and this is
main video so i wait that this is my actual video
okay so you can see my actual weight is a 71.50 and my estimated weight
i checked already this is 71.94 so this is the accuracy we have right now
so yeah our main target is after the human so this is the human 3d model right
so after that what about the animal you know animal they don't have the weighing
machine okay so we can do we can just capture the animal picture and then we can
segment the body with the help of the point cloud we have the clusters and the
convex algorithm then we are using this though and after that we have the conclusion yeah
the aging the dignity and we can do and this is our team
uh yeah so we what we are doing exactly we are doing
the body mass volume weight estimation the height estimation
with the ai only that's it thank you so much so this is my team
yeah please come
yeah
how would you do this if you didn't have a 3d camera if you just had an ordinary camera
or maybe two of them yeah so you know what like for the 3d camera if we mount our camera on the top
of the patient then we have a patient on the bed right so what the 3d camera is doing this is the
depth quality okay so we can capture the depth quality of that 3d camera so this is the cost
cutting for the hospital also and that's also because i don't want to go to the second camera
like the side angle for the patient so that's why this is the chip you know that the interior
sense camera d1415 there are the different cameras also for example the kinect camera d450 camera
but that is another features we have okay so but this one is a cheap camera and i'm trying like
with the just mobile phone i'm trying for this one like i have just ordinary camera and i'm just
2d image i have and with the 2d image i'm just converting to the 3d image so i'm just uh doing
that one also so right now i'm using the 3d camera anyone so where are the applications of this is why you
have to use a camera to measure the weight so when it with the target i didn't read fast so this is
okay so our main goal is uh we can provide this solution to the healthcare you know the hospitality
and the home based also so we have like suppose for example we have an application then we can
download this application we can directly capture the 2d image and then we can uh you know we can say
like this is the weight and most of the problem is like the aging you know the frailty disease and the
other one so they can't measure weight every day they can't go hospital every day so that that is
the main point so my idea is if suppose we have a one mirror and the for that person they are going
to every day for the brush okay so in the mirror i have just camera i'm just going with the mirror so
i can detect the body and i can detect the 2d image and then we can say yeah this is the body volume
and this is very important from the doses so yeah so the doctors can say yeah this is the doses we can
go forward with that one so like a bmi and the other one and make it contactless and yeah this is
like a contactless so we don't wanna we don't wanna buy the weighing scale anything yep thank you thank you so
