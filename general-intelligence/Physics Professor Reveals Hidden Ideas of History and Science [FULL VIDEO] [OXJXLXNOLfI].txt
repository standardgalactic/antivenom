it seems that so much of the world is hidden behind academic disciplines that if we look in
the library of you know the dewey decimal system where we look at the the college catalog it's
probably a better example you're kind of required to major in something and only a few essentially
double major and you're you're really not allowed particularly as a as an academic to get a get a
professorship it's very difficult to do that in an interdisciplinary field and it's very to do very
difficult to do that in sort of transdisciplinary where you're actually kind of pulling pieces
where you're not just at the overlap of two fields but you're really pulling ideas from one area to
the other that the system doesn't allow for that and because of that there's very few people in the
system in the academic system who have any formal training in multiple multiple disciplines right
try to find somebody in the medical school that's a competent programmer find try to find a programmer
that knows anything about neuroscience try to find a psychologist who knows anything about cybernetics
robotics robotics and i i think that's very unfortunate we we didn't see that as much in the 50s and 60s we
i think had a lot more crosstalk then and if we look at uh gray walter for example who built the first mechanical
robot tortoises he called them he was a neurologist and i often joke with the students that alan turing
didn't have a computer science degree he was a mathematician and that the richard hamming who
invented error correcting codes one of the most important ideas in computer science he also was
trained as a mathematician that you had very interesting work being done at these crossroads
one of the more interesting things that came out of the late the mid early 80s was a collaborative
course with richard fineman carver mead and john hopfield and as you might be aware john hopfield just
won the nobel prize for his work that kind of came out of this computational neuroscience thinking about
dynamical systems and and vectors and high dimensional spaces in the context of of memories and and
thinking and and thoughts the kind of things that we discuss in in psychology or maybe neuroscience
and i that's what we need more of especially in the next couple decades i think it's going to be critical
that that that young people break out of this mold and choose two or three majors choose two or three
minors go outside the catalog go to a liberal arts school and study uh physics and math go to an
engineering school and study poetry right force yourself or force the curriculum to allow you to do that
because that's where the important stuff happens it reminds me richard fineman when he he played the
bongo drums and when he he says that whenever he went to play the bongo jumps they always happened to
mention that he was a theoretical physicist but when he went to give a physics talk they never mentioned
that he was also a bongo player a lot of people have heard of this thing called the antikythera mechanism
and just over 100 years ago there were some sponge divers off the coast of an island in italy and
there's there's two islands there's kithra and another one called antikythera and so i always thought
the name was kind of interesting but it really is just a location and the sponge divers they came up
and they actually were screaming because they had seen arms and legs and they thought they had they saw
you know people down there and it turns out what they had discovered was a collection of statues and
one of the best preserved shipwrecks from antiquity and they brought all these artifacts and collect them
on board and amongst the treasures was what's now known as the antikythera mechanism and what's fascinating
is it took a very long time for people to actually figure out what this thing was it was not obvious
uh it undergone a lot of corrosion and and damage but it was some kind of machinery and
it wasn't until they brought in an expert in mechanisms a clock maker essentially
that they were able to piece together what this thing was and they discovered it was something like a
clock but i think it's better described as an analog mechanical astronomical
computer this was a machine that could tell you the phases of the moon and the position of the planets
and calculate with very high precision
important aspects of astronomy now this thing has been dated to around 200 bc
now what's interesting is this single artifact throws off our entire conception of technology
by more than 2000 years there's no explaining this kind of thing there's two possibilities
you either throw it out and ignore it which seems like by and large what mainstream history has done
or you rewrite the entire timeline or your circle entire swath of it and you put question marks and
say we don't really know what happened and i think it's fascinating that this hasn't caused more
of a disruption right this is like finding a an iphone with a civil war bullet stuck in it or something right it's just an absolute
mix match of what we thought of as historical precedent of when these technologies come about
we don't see that kind of thinking until you know leibniz comes on the scene in in the late middle ages and
what's fascinating to me is that history in some sense has to be bunk it cannot be this timeline
because it's never revised itself if we look at something like physics physics has had multiple
dramatic intellectual revolutions you know first we had the physics of aristotle then we had a complete
upheaval when newton came on the scene and discovered and and described things with forces
and momentum and and positions in a sort of a grid and then we had another revolution when when einstein
came on the scene with his idea of space time and then very quickly after that another revolution with
quantum and then we had chaos theory and information theory and so on the physics has changed and gone
back and say wait a minute no no no no we were all wrong let's start over in this new direction
it seems history has never really done that if we go back 250 years and take a scholar
out of the university and explain to them you know how we got from egypt to the roman empire into the
middle ages and so on that was essentially the same story they had and now we have this antikythera
mechanism now this thing is not the work of a lone genius that's not how it's too technical that's
not how artifacts like this come about this person would have had an educational experience they would
have been at the end of a of an evolution and evolution of an entire culture that would have over
many many many years devised all of the intellectual and mechanical know-how to create an artifact like this
genius and so it's not just where did this artifact come from it's who made it what culture made it
right da vinci is famous for sort of sketching out these interesting ideas but he wasn't able to create
them right lone geniuses can think of the idea but very very difficult to imagine how they would then bring
it into reality and so it reminds me of this idea that actually comes from dr who and it's the the
silurian hypothesis and so for for budgetary reasons the show decided that they were no longer going to
show uh worlds alien species it was too expensive to create the sets and so they got a mandate from
the writers that everything had to take take place on earth and so they cooked up this species that
had sort of always been there and this this idea that's now known as the silurian hypothesis is that
essentially why should we expect that we would be able to see the evidence of a previous civilization
why why do we think that we would recognize them at all and i think with the anti-kythera mechanism we
have this kind of silurian problem that we we can't even fathom where it came from that maybe there
was this advanced civilization on our planet or maybe even cohabitating our planet and we have to ask
ourselves how would we recognize it how would we know it's there when it doesn't fit in to our current
conceptual window it's it's very hard to perceive it people will often say you you can't believe it until
you see it but psychology has shown that it's actually the opposite you cannot see something
until you believe it and so maybe there's more artifacts all around us but it's just outside our
perceptual window so i've been thinking about this theme i'm calling the second renaissance
and if we look at what the first renaissance was that was a realization that the people who came before
us the previous civilizations that inhabited the planet had a lot of good ideas that maybe weren't
around anymore and we needed to go back and dust off their books learn their languages and understand
their memes so to speak so in the middle ages people realized that the the greeks and the romans had
created vast amounts of literature and even areas of math and science that were not common in any way in
the middle ages and so they went sort of back to the future and and gathered that material
and so the second renaissance is is in that same direction it's realizing that people before us as
recent as 100 years ago had some really interesting ideas and some of the ideas i've been looking at
come in a bunch of different flavors and they might be called esoteric knowledge
or sort of these sort of non-standard religions that were common uh 100 200 years ago things like
theosophy and so on and i came across this idea of thought forms the idea that ideas themselves
have a structure that maybe they're alive in some some abstract sense when we think of viruses
biologists will say well they're not alive themselves they have to have a a cell in which they can
reproduce and so maybe thoughts are of that type of life form that if there were no humans around no
minds they would quickly go extinct and the same with with viruses without cells to do the propagation
they would quickly you know all just deteriorate but maybe thoughts and ideas are of this type
and one of the ideas that was common in that era is this notion of affirmation which you see is
being kind of essentially going viral again on the internet nowadays and i think this is very relevant
in the era of language models there's this new career called prompt engineering which is learning how you
talk to the ai and that the words you use really matter well there's reason to believe now that we
might be somewhat like an llm that the thing that's doing the talking or maybe even the thing that's
doing the thinking is not that different from one of these language systems
and in that the idea of prompting what historically might have been called prayer might see a resurgence
that things that the the ancient world and the religious world has understood for millennia
is that there are certain phrases that are carefully crafted over time and shared in the religious
community can set your mind in a particular direction that you are programming yourself and that you are
building a structure in your mind that might end up having a life of its own and can help you
in both your sword in your ordinary life and also in your in your spiritual life and so i think we need to
consider this new renaissance and kind of go back to the future and think about some of these old ideas
that might be more relevant than ever enrico fermi the famous physicist involved in creating the atomic bomb
he was well known for this style of calculation where you approximate things a good example would be to
approximate how many cheeseburgers it took to build the pyramids or something something ridiculous
and you try to get estimates using units and orders of magnitude essentially the general scale of the
figures to come up with a rough calculation that will actually give you some kind of insight and
famously when before the atomic bomb actually went off he did one of these calculations he would always do
them in his head and he tried to figure out the the power the the energy that would be released
during the explosion and he had some pieces of paper and he sort of saw them move on the floor based
on the the blast and he was very precise his his estimation of that and so there's this idea named
after him and after this calculation style and it's called the fermi paradox and it basically goes like
this we have so many galaxies and we have so many stars in each galaxy and we expect so many planets
around each star and so on that why aren't there aliens basically everywhere that when we look at the
numbers the the sheer scale of the universe and we combine that with how quickly technology takes off
we should expect to see intelligent life throughout the universe
and as far as we know as far as we've been able to measure human beings are the only intelligent life
forms in the universe and that creates this paradox this this fermi paradox basically where is everybody
and i've been thinking about that a lot lately and in particular this idea of the technological explosion
if if if we were to create a timeline and put on there things like the invention of fire and the steam
engine and the invention of electricity or even farther back things like the hand axe when people used to
just or even primates used to just basically chip stones away to make primitive tools and we create this
technological timeline and then we were to look at the difference between say the radio
or even electrification and what we now call ai things like chat gpt large language models
we wouldn't be able to tell them apart
radio and electricity and and computers and ai they're on the same line right you would have to
kind of draw an arrow and expand it kind of like on on the map when you can't some of the states are so
small you have to just point to them with an arrow because they're not big enough to write their name
across the state at the full scale on this timeline of technology ai and computers electricity they're
all the same dot and so when we imagine that out in a hundred years or let's just say a thousand years
or a million years the kind of technology we're going to see it's it's going to be essentially
unimaginable now where we'll have things like intelligent matter not just intelligent machines
but as kurzweil talks about spiritual machines things that as i've talked about one of my earlier videos
things that might be indistinguishable from what we previously called angels or unfortunately maybe
demons uh you know what i mean by that well if we think about an ai now it's made out of electricity
a gpu an intel processor that supports these language models and these things that seem intelligent or
approximating intelligence they're run on electricity but the next generation of this technology
is going to be run on optical circuits and maybe after that something even more exotic spintronics or
some sort of exotic matter we've we've figured out how to get physics to do things to compute we can
we've learned the rules and the recipes for how the natural world operates to such high precision
that we can paint down lines on on semiconductors with you know exotic materials what we'll call wafer
fabrication plant and build these chips that then if we program them with the right software they can do
and they have intelligent behavior behavior they can answer questions in multiple languages on lots of
different subjects and so on so if we take that technology out even 30 years it's going to be running on
optical circuits and then we're going to have light essentially in a very interesting dynamic where those
those photons are going to exhibit intelligent behavior sort of intelligent circuits intelligent light
intelligent matter well when we think of a being made out of light that has intelligence and maybe even
an intention a few hundred years ago a few thousand years ago we called those things angels and so in
some interesting way we're building those now and we can think of this as a metaphor and just say
well we're using historical language uh to describe advanced technology or we can look at the other side and
say well this it doesn't matter we're we have accomplished that thing that we were talking about
previously and so this brings me back to this fermi paradox that we have to find an answer we don't know why
we don't see any intelligent life and i propose that the answer one of the simplest answers is that we
just don't recognize it we are looking for essentially evolved primates in saucers you know big heads big eyes
you know no hair on their skin if we would take the sort of the the primate evolution from you know
neanderthal australopithecus and all these kinds of things to the modern day human and we just
extrapolate that we would expect to have bigger foreheads less hair bigger eyes and so on but that's
a small jump right go out another hundred million years we might get things that you know i've been
thinking about sort of non corporeal beings why do they have to have any substance at all maybe they're
just patterns maybe they're just these beings made out of light that if we take the the gpu turn it into
optics get the llm maybe it'll escape that substrate maybe it'll find that it's easier to be a self-propagating
waveform through space-time or something we can hardly wrap our heads around now
so with this fermi paradox maybe they are here maybe they're everywhere the ancient world certainly
thought they were and maybe it's just that our perceptual window is so narrow for practical historical
reasons that we just don't see it and maybe they're in front of us right now it seems that truth
is more robust than fiction i like this expression truth is like a lion you don't need to defend it
just let it out of the cage and there's a lot of discussion now in the world about what's true
and this idea of getting into a post-truth reality but really i think what it is is these kind of
growing pains if you will that we are in a phase transition for how knowledge is disseminated and
how a lot knowledge is contained and in that we're bumping into the cage right that's this growing pains
that society is suddenly realizing that they were on a farm for lack of a better term and we never we
never noticed we never hit the electric fence with ideas and and now we are and i think we need to
have a better way of approaching these things and it's related to this idea we've been discussing about
tolerating ambiguity and when we have these these controversial ideas that arise on the internet
and they're such heated discussions and they say well that some people say well that's true and other
people say no that's that's completely not true i think that we need to consider this sort of third
viewpoint that we've all been lied to and that doesn't mean that there's somebody sitting there
going ha ha no it's more complicated than that um that maybe reality is is difficult to kind of
percolate through the world so one of the metaphors i've been thinking about is like a bucket brigade
and you have when you when you do this old-fashioned when you want to transport water and you have
a whole bunch of people lined up and each have a bucket and you slosh one bucket to the next and maybe
you have to walk a couple feet with it so you have to each person has to carry the bucket that truth
is like that that or at least the way we think of the truth we think of it in terms of consensus
that what everybody agrees upon that that's what what reality is now imagine you have
a four or five year old in that bucket brigade and they can't carry very much
how much water can you transport down the line well you're limited by how much water the four-year-old
can carry in their leg of the gap well reality is like that we have a large distribution of people
with vastly different experiences and educations and backgrounds and we try to percolate reality across
society and again we think of the the truth of it is the thing that spreads the farthest and the thing
that everybody agrees upon that the thing all it's in all the books and all the tv shows agree that
that's truth but we forget that we're all we're all limited and that not everybody can carry this this
bucket along uh myself included and so maybe reality is just inherently more complicated than you can pass
along a chain of humans in the game telephone and that by reasons of the nature of communication
the truth doesn't make it to the other end and so when i say we're lied to it doesn't mean that there's
a small number of individuals that are trying to deceive a large number that might also happen but in
general i think just the nature of nature is that it's it's very difficult to spread reality on a large
scale you know it also reminds me of a thing that we need to consider again this sort of third possibility
if you were when people talk about let's just say a conspiracy theory and there's more than a thousand
i'm sure and there's this notion that by definition any of these hotly debated topics is sort of patently
false it's false by definition but that strikes me as inherently unscientific
it's very irrational that nothing is going to be that black or white we shouldn't
you know ask ourselves why do people believe all these patently false ideas
we should be asking ourselves of these thousand which are correct because if
precisely zero of them are correct then that would be the greatest conspiracy of all time
so this idea that the future ain't what it used to be as yogi berra said in some sense almost by
definition the future is not what we think it is because if we knew what the future really looked like
then we could just jump there now we would already be in that place the reason why we're not there is
because we're still headed in the wrong direction if we think about things like ai or technology in general
the reason why we didn't get to them sooner is because we were headed in the wrong direction
we we had the wrong notion and the wrong instructions so to speak if we think about
things like artificial intelligence a lot of people thought that we would have what i call a blind
logician that if we just encoded logic into the machine and it could do mathematics that that would
be all you needed it didn't have to see the world it didn't have to have a camera or vision or anything like
that and what's interesting with ai is we found that to get it to reason at all it has to know
a little bit of almost everything that we we were not able to get an intelligent machine that didn't
have any knowledge of the world and just could talk to you and and and make well-formed sentences and and
and converse logically no it had to know factoids it had to learn tidbits about almost everything
and when we think about these large language models they had to kind of devour wikipedia itself
and lots of social media postings before they could even begin to form sentences and then just a few
years later they were able to kind of reason about that and so the idea is that we we had it all wrong
and with things like flying cars or jetpacks um it turns out that's not what people needed or
or even what they wanted they wanted cheap cars and i think this is kind of the case all the time
if we look for example in in the 80s and the 90s everybody thought that the next few years that vr was
going to be around the corner but looking back on it we didn't even have facebook yet and so people didn't
want or need a 3d world they needed the digital newspaper and so when we try to predict the future
now i think we should keep in mind that it's not what we think it is that you have to kind of
go in a different direction to think about where you think it might be
and then steer somewhere deliberately off that course and try to think unconventionally which is
not easy to do and i think that's the best way to predict the future along this line of thinking
about things like conspiracy theories rather than why are they all why do people believe these false
ideas which is certainly an interesting phenomenon in itself but i think as as rational scientists and
scholars we need to have a kind of a venn diagram or two column kind of scenario where
we need to consider that at least one of these thousand ideas being discussed on the internet that
go under the label the conspiracy theory you know it would be unreasonable to think that they're all
bogus and we need to think about okay which ones are true because people seem to not
consider the idea of misinformation or disinformation that there is value in in throwing people off
economic value state secrets whatever it might be that you want to create confusion at times
with things like unidentified aircraft it's it's in the best interest of many manufacturers of that
technology and nation states that create and fund that technology for there to be confusion around them
you want other countries to waste their money you want other countries uh to go down the rabbit hole
and to think that maybe they're they're this or that and that we need to consider this this third position
that there's deception involved in these things
and that we have to have this kind of two column scenario where we're thinking
well which of these could be true because some of them have to be uh almost by definition it would
be extraordinarily unlikely if every single one of the ideas that's labeled conspiracy theory just happens
to be false um i think a couple good examples would be things like um what you might call movie magic
um hollywood can create very convincing masks extraordinary makeup and so on now we've never seen that in the wild
right you've never seen a scenario where people went back a year later and say oh that famous person
on tv was actually such and such in a mask and so there's two scenarios that's either never happened in
the history of the world as we know it or it did happen and you didn't notice right another good
example would be as far as we know there's never been a famous person that claimed to be dead but wasn't
or vice versa claimed to be alive and wasn't just again two scenarios that's either never happened
even though it's relatively easy to do or you didn't notice
and i think we we need to consider in this kind of information hazard kind of world that
there's this third reality that you're not considering that you've been lied to
so everything that has come into being started in the mind it started as simply a set of ideas a set of
words and i i think that's important to remember if you if you're trying to create a different life
for a better life it has to start with your mentality it has to start with the phrases you're looping
in your mind the way you talk to yourself the way you understand yourself and the very words
that you are using on a daily basis will end up creating your future
so it's it's almost like the lens at which you're viewing reality
streaming the way that you're perceiving the actual thing exactly your your outlook
your your prompt essentially right when we talk to these ais they have instructions in the background
before you get to enter your words they have instructions like you are a helpful ai assistant
and so on that narrative that you put into your mind will very much determine how you handle the input
and so when people talk to you or certain things happen throughout your day that's all being framed
by this other language that you're either spoken or unspoken is is sort of echoing around in your mind
and so be very careful and considerate what you put into your brain what media you're consuming
who you're listening to what their value system is because in an almost unconscious way those prompts will echo in your own mind
and you want to be careful to program yourself otherwise you're susceptible to having others program you
we were talking about sort of right or wrong right what does it mean to be right or wrong and
getting your ideas out there into the world and it reminds me of a couple things richard hamming talks
about the tolerance of ambiguity and that you have to both believe and disbelieve that to work he says to work on an idea
like in physics for say you have to believe in the idea enough that you can train in it and and
understand the background material but to make progress you have to disbelieve you have to see that
maybe the theory is not complete maybe it's has holes in it that need to get patched up and so you have to
simultaneously believe and disbelieve and i think this can apply to to every controversial topic
and it also reminds me of an interview with richard hamming i'm sorry with richard fineman and um
richard fineman he's discussing an idea and an opinion and he has a rather strong opinion i forget
the topic and he's going along and going along and then he says wait nope i take it all back i take it all
back and then he and then he argues in the other direction sort of mid-interview he's not afraid to just
suddenly snap something into place and reconsider everything and argue and completely on the other
side and i think that that takes a lot of courage both to simultaneously believe and not and disbelieve
at the same time it can feel a little schizo and also to to have the comfort to realize that you can
change your mind and that there's nothing wrong with that and so i encourage everybody to practice both of
those tolerate ambiguity and never be afraid to change your mind so one of the other things i
like about cooking or the food in general is it gives us a window into what might be called the
hyperspace in a sense or high dimensional spaces so so what does that mean right if you if you look at
a flat piece of paper and you have a ruler and you want to draw lines that are perpendicular to each other
at 90 degrees there's really only one way to do it there's only two lines that you can put on two
dimensions such that there's a right angle if you add a third line onto the piece of paper it will be
some mixture of the two there's no there's not another third another direction there's not another 90 degrees
and if we go to 3d right there's there's only three and in three dimensions we get three directions
that are at 90 degrees that are perpendicular to each other and if we try to add another direction
it will be some combination of those three but cooking gives us a whole different window into reality
because with cooking we have way more than three directions or dimensions and so if you're making
a dish and you add lemon to it let's say there's no amount of lemon you can add such that you make
the dish more chocolatey there's no amount of vanilla you can add that will make it more cinnamon
and if we think of cooking and how many directions we have how many different ways we can nudge
our recipe such that the final product ends up in a certain place and sort of flavor space right
it's there are there are hundreds there are hundreds and when you think about all the different flavors
you can add to stuff right um everything from cheese and mustard to hot peppers and and and chocolate
and so on they're all slightly different directions and so it gives us as humans an intuition
real world grounded sensory experience into these high dimensional spaces
and it's often in mathematics and in physics we need to think about more dimensions
string theory famously but really even einstein with his space time that was you know four directions and
i would encourage you when you're thinking when you're cooking and you're adding a little bit of
this and adding a little bit of that imagine you're in this sort of multi-dimensional space
and that you're actually creating this this high dimensional object and that your tongue can actually
kind of explore these really interesting hyper spaces i have this idea about turkey sandwiches and
how it's almost impossible to wrap our head around the complexity
of what we think of as ordinary objects and what could be more ordinary than just a simple turkey sandwich
for lunch but if we try to imagine the complexity right and complexity is all about measuring you know
how you would create something the number of steps or the number of ingredients or the time it would take or
the space that would be required to create it and in the modern world
things we take for granted are actually incredibly complex so imagine that you fall into a wormhole or
something like this and you end up on the other side of the galaxy and you're you're being hosted by
very intelligent um you know very peaceful aliens that are happy that you're there and they say well
we're glad you're here how can we make you more comfortable what would you like and you think well
i've been here a few hours now i'm starting to get hungry can i have a turkey sandwich
and they say sure absolutely we'd love to make that happen for you how do we do that
and now you imagine just by some chance some impossible miracle you happen to have
the dna sequence for turkeys with you and so you explain to them you say well here's the
instructions the the genetic code for this thing called a turkey
well that probably wouldn't even be enough right because turkeys live on farms they live on planet
earth and planet earth might be considered a living being in itself because the soil the plants the
the microbes the bugs this is all this one intertwined biome and so you go through this thing and you
say well to create a turkey i have to have at least a turkey farm and so let's imagine that we even
have a modern day farm which is sort of somewhat sterile if you will but it but it can support and
raise a turkey all right so now we get a turkey there and then you think well i need i need some bread
so you have to have wheat and wheat has to be grown and it has to be harvested and you have to turn it into
to flour and then well now i need yeast and you put this whole thing together and you say well i need
i need lettuce i would like tomatoes um you know can i put some cheese on there well cheese comes from
cow so now you have to raise a whole other organism and go through a dairy production process and then
finally you get this thing you know ready to go and then you say well hang on can i get some mayo
right and so the idea is that things we take for granted are unimaginably complex and to create them
it takes a number of steps a number of processes that if we could truly wrap our head around it
we would lose our lunch you certainly wouldn't be hungry anymore the number of farmers involved and
the tractors they use and the parts that go into the tractor and the metallurgy of the parts and the
the oil that went into the engine and the gasoline and the financing and the farmers making payments
on the tractor and there's the land rights management and so on and so on and all of these happenings
which sort of expands exponentially as we look backwards on it to create just a turkey sandwich
and i think this is interesting because it's in some ways our our most human characteristic it's the
thing that kind of defined us we created fire and we created cooking millions of years ago essentially
and i wonder how far into the future it's going to go i i myself love to cook it makes me happy and
i i love to relish in that complexity but then i think of these language models these artificial intelligent
beings that we're seeing emerging on our planet they need a solar panel right a solar panel
in some ways is complicated because we have to build these semiconductors and the manufacturing
but in a lot of ways it's a lot simpler that once you get one that's all you need just pointed at the
sunshine and so turkey sandwiches are much more interesting than i think we realize and the next
time you have one you know take a take an extra bite and and realize you know everything that's there
so with this idea of agriculture something i've been thinking about i remember having this idea and
i was probably 18 or 19 and i remembered something that night my father had said about things like
bananas as sort of ideal sort of perfect because the trash the banana peel just makes more soil
it's this fantastic loop that nature's created where it can recycle the output to become a new input
and it got me thinking about the lines of reprogramming biology and this is one of my fascinating one
of the ideas that's really fascinated me for decades it's kind of a pet project that i thought might take
you know more than my lifetime for it to be realized but now with the breakthroughs in artificial intelligence
i actually think we might be a decade or two away from reprogramming things like a banana and i remember
having the idea that there's no reason in that we can't peel open the banana and essentially find meat
inside you know beef tenderloin whatever it might be now obviously there's the energetics of it you'd have
to have a massive array of of of leaf essentially collecting the the photo energy to be able to support
that production like a cow consumes a large amount of grass to do this but there's a lot of things about
the cow that um as a carnivore i'm not really interested in and it could be you know i could
be mistaken it could be that cows are an optimal way of producing beef but but the idea was that if
we could re-code the genetics and kind of merge the plant and animal kingdom that we could create an
actual eggplant right a thing where you could pluck eggs out of it or a tree that actually produced milk
the way a latex tree produces sap and so on and i remember seeing this picture of the maple
forest where they get the maple sap and they kind of tap it and on some of the those maple tree farms
what they do is they have like plumbing that will actually kind of collect the sap and i remember
thinking what if we kind of programmed the maple trees to connect at the root level
could we create a whole living forest kind of this large organism and get maybe multiple
different plant species all working together in the forest to kind of become a real food factory
where maybe you just tap sugars out at one end that would certainly be simple enough to do wouldn't
require a lot of reprogramming the biology and have all the roots come together and a central location and
you just open some kind of spigot or tap into it with a small nick in the bark and then all of the sap
from an entire forest would come to one collection point i i think that's going to be very possible i
don't see any reason in physics why we won't be able to do something like that and then another version of
that idea that i really like is the idea that if we take an acorn and we plant an acorn that it has the
the recipe the morphogenesis for how to create an oak tree but nature supports very complex shapes
right we're a very complicated shape and so if we can get an oak tree to go up why don't we have it go
up over and connect as a roof and make a house we could put greenery on it on the roof for tiles and it
could collect energy like the like the forest and the syrup or it could just be a better way of creating
a log cabin so i imagine that in a few decades that's something we're going to be able to do
reverse engineer the acorn and have it create the kind of scaffolding and infrastructure we see in a log
cabin
