And I started to realize there were two types of information in the body.
There was digital information, which is DNA, and a lot of the epigenome, which is just as important for life and longevity, is analog.
Analog information is stored in the body as structures of how the DNA is actually wrapped.
And it's in four dimensions. It's not in one or two.
I started to think about correction data. Was there correction data really stored in every cell?
And we started to look for it.
And we were wondering, how do we go back, like Claude Shannon suggested, to not just slow down the noise, but actually reset the information in the cell?
Here I'm saying maybe it's stored in the form of RNA and DNA.
