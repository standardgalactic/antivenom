good evening hackathon enthusiasts our group is called
nice the club of the day club and our topic is functionalized hydrogels for enamel and repair
devices so to give you a little background on dental health um tooth decay is the most common
oral disease in the world and the world health organization estimated that 2.5 billion people
have untreated tooth decay as of 2022 the picture on the shot on the side shows in the stages of tooth
decay but to summarize it certain foods um are acidic for your teeth that lead to plaque buildup
and cause mineral loss which can lead to decay in enamel denture dentin and decay in the bulb which
is the nerve center in your tooth and studies have found a link between poor oral health and
increased cardiovascular and respiratory mortality as you see on the side chronic pardonitis an example
of poor oral health and the things on the side that it can lead to an example how it can lead to
diabetes is oral infections can have an inflammatory response that leads to elevated blood sugar levels
resulting in diabetes so now we talk about tooth mineralization which is the process of your teeth
absorbing minerals that will allow it to become stronger and repair itself and the most common mineral
a bio mineral is called hypoxia appetite which is what you see on the side so this mineral
is very common in dent and dental care products and it's formed it deposits on your teeth and forms an
animal indention and the common minerals for this would be calcium phosphate and fluoride as fluoride
enhances enamel resistance to acidity which causes mineral loss and as you see on the side this is a
heretical assembly of how this biomineral scales up and forms enamel and denture okay hello everyone so
this is hydrogel hydrogel are 3d network 3d cross-linked polymer networks are con uh contain a large amount
of water and it also uses gelatin as gelatin is a natural polymer and which is made from the hydrolytic
degradation of protein from collagen and it has distinctive uh structure uh which is um which is
which gives it a medical several medical benefits and to enhance its properties it is cross-linked with
silica as well and silica can act as a by carrier of bioactive ions and it also facilitates the
uh sustained release and it has also excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability which used for
the medical use so we introduce the animal repair retainers which is made from silica gelatin hydrogel
and these retainers are functionalized with uh fluoride flow fluoride for uh re for remineralization and
calcium and uh phosphorus phosphate to support animal regeneration and additionally it also
use potassium nitrate for desensitization which helps to reduce the which helps to reduce the tooth
sensitivity and it has uh why why this technology has um effective because it has some uh key aspects
which has the uh tunable mechanical properties which can customize the property based on their needs and
sustained release over three to six months and it also has the biocompatible gelatin network which is
safe for the oral use all right so let's get into the experimental design i don't have much time okay
uh basically we're going to use what's called a soul gel method it's kind of like a dump and stir
24 to 48 hours of our polymers our organic components our ion solutions we're going to tune
we're going to try different formulations uh to tune our properties such as porosity which affects
controlled release um we'll do some characterization chemical composition surface morphology and even
some 3d nanoscale stuff um some testing using acid etching to test the efficacy of our hydrogel i can
talk more about that later and then to conclude basically what we want to do is we want to just
have this hydrogel be applied to um to a larger scale retainer mold scaffold um with optimized properties
in it for comfort for nightly use and for long-term uh wear and so uh also we want it to work in the
sense that um it prevents uh mineral loss and promotes enamel regrowth and repair ultimately we can
create this affordable and readily available commercial uh device that targets a growing
multi-billion dollar industry in dental care and eventually we can provide over-the-counter uh
dental care for consumers around the world thank you
questions
so what i see here is a commercial product right a well-done concept so where do you see that or
what do you see that the innovation will be to take this product faster to industry or to the market
because there are a lot of products that can promise the same or similar solutions so what is that key
component that we can say yes you can have funding for the prototyping and take it to the market faster
um so i think there's several things the first thing is that i don't think there's anything like
this out there it's kind of analogous to um toothpaste that has whitening uh ingredients and then you have
whitening strips the whitening strips is more effective because it's on uh your teeth for a longer time
we do have toothpaste that promote enamel repair but there is not anything like a sort of treatment
that you can wear overnight that would do this uh prolonged and more in intensive treatment and then
also there's a market for it because a lot of people um you know when it comes to uh getting these uh
treatments and for repair um there's a thing of do a lot of people have dental insurance or a lot of
these procedures are very expensive so um this would have a large target market um for people and
these uh when if you run the numbers which we didn't include it's it's it's not very expensive to make
and it's not very time consuming um it's just more so getting the the steps like testing and all that done
is
thank you
