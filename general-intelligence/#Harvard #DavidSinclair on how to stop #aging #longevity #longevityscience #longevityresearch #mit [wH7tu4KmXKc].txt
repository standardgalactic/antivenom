is it is it really just that we break down or is it something more than that through a wormhole
a deep dive i would say i got really deep into information theory i got deep into the work of
claude shannon and his colleagues and and things clicked they started to really make sense aging
isn't so much a linear process it's a circular process aging is unlikely just to be wear and
tear but it's actually a software problem i began looking for ways to test that and we still continue
to test that there are times in my lab where we have still have confusing results and we were
challenging this hypothesis all the time but compared to 10 years ago we we are much more i
i should say i'm much more enthusiastic about it it's explaining a lot of things that have been going
on not just in my lab now but but globally you'll hear more about that from vadim about epigenetic
clocks and you know we've been working in my lab on epigenetics since day one and even before i had a lab
