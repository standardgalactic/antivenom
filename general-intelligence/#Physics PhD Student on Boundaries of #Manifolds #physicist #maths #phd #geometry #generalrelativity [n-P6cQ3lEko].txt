like when you normally think of like the boundary of like a manifold you might think of it being
on the exterior and surrounding like the interior components but for the complex one sphere it has
the boundary at its very center very peculiar i should also mention that this um complex um
one sphere it allows you to embed a one-dimensional manifold in a 1d space time essentially because
like the complex like oftentimes when we think of like complex spaces like we think of it as like
oh it's a complex plane and that like that sort of terminology makes it sound like it's like the
complex plane is like 2d but actually it's still only one-dimensional complex numbers can be a bit
confusing and tricky this has a i think this might have a connection with what's known as
whitney's embedding theorem it states that if you have an n manifold you can um always embed it in
at least um two and them in real dimensions and this means you can like let's say you have like
a circle and um it's like a one-dimensional manifold and um let's say you were confined to
like real dimensions if you wanted to embed it you'd have to embed it on a plane and if you had
like a sphere two sphere then you'd have to embed it in a 3d space time as like the surface of like a
three ball essentially whitney's embedding theorem says if you have an n manifold you can embed it in
like two end um real dimensions where it's not going to intersect with itself
