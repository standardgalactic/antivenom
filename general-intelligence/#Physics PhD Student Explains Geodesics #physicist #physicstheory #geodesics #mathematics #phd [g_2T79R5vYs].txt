There's a really simple like basic and trivial example of a complex Riemannian manifold and that
is essentially what I call a complex one sphere. It essentially has the metric negative one divided
by z squared and if you were to plot it on the complex plane you would find that it has a
singularity at z equals zero. An interesting like this manifold has a lot of interesting properties.
Geodesics like if you were to like go like a geodesic around the center let's say this is zero
z equals zero then the geodesics would be like essentially closed circles but you could also
like go off on an angle and let's say like spiral inwards instead.
