Good evening, everyone. My name is Akilah and this is my tips in the evening.
So, imagine a future where AI can protect the drugs which can fight neuro-generative diseases like Alzheimer's.
Instead of waiting for decades for new treatments, we could identify the existing drugs which could be used, right?
So that's where our project is really exploring.
So, we have developed an AI-powered model where it predicts the existing FDA-approved drug could relate the Alzheimer's diseases, proteins.
So, while we have worked on synthetic data, our whole point is how AI can be used in existing drugs.
AI can be used in this thing.
So, Alzheimer's, now we have over 50 million people in the world that is facing with Alzheimer's diseases, but yet no cure.
Why? Because the traditional discovery of the drug development is slow, expensive and inefficient.
It could take decades.
Now, we have to think a faster way and cost-effective way to slow down this process.
That's where AI comes in.
We have built a model where it helps the people to reuse the drugs.
So, the solution to these problems is the cost-effectiveness.
We leverage our AI to predict existing data of FDA-related drugs so that they are able to use beta, amyloid, and tau proteins, and these are more cost-effective,
which allows the researchers to implement our systems to pretty much look at, to pretty much to get the drugs to implement faster.
Yeah.
Actually, we have a model.
There's a model.
The main thing is actually our motive is we have to use the already existed drugs.
Actually, to find the new drug, it costs most of the investment, and also takes a lot of time as well.
We took these on drug-related data sets and the protein data sets.
By using these data sets, we feed the AI model.
We use the random forest model.
The random forest model actually gives the 88% accuracy.
Let me show you.
Just let me walk you through my code.
Okay.
Actually, we developed an AI model that gives the accuracy of 88%.
And also, we built the front-end development.
There, where the user or doctor can enter his details, like his name, his ethnicity, his medical history,
and he has to enter his enter protein target.
So, once he enter all these details, the user will not click on the predict.
So, after click on the predict, the thing is going to take the results from the back-end that related to our AI model.
So, it's going to display all the recommended drugs.
So, that's how we're going to recommend the already-existed drugs to the customer or user.
Okay.
Real-world impact, how is this going to be beneficial for pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and healthcare providers,
and for also biotech-stabbing companies?
Yeah.
Hello.
Next slide.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hello.
As we all know that our model is currently limped to the Alzheimer's disease.
So, but we can extend our model to the, a lot of neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson's, ALS, and different number of diseases.
So, it will help the doctors or researchers to predict the, to predict the medicine as soon as possible.
So, right now, in our model, we are using the, an AI model call.
So, we are using an AI model.
So, this more, no.
So, this graph neural network model works closely with the molecules and gives the results.
So, it will give the more accurate results.
So, this is the thing we're going to develop in the future.
So, in conclusion, I can say that this AI model is just an idea.
Yeah.
So, with this type of AI model, so we can cure or reduce the age-related diseases.
Yeah.
That's it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Good question.
The question is that you're looking at which are .
Star .
Is that actually has said, to find the new drugs, that leads alone to something.
So, we don't know how much duration it's going to take.
Maybe its first time, Initially.
Maybe more than that.
And so it takes a lot of investment, like it's a ,
puts outlets on investment.
So, we thought in a way that why we are going to create a new dimension,
any interesting dimension, is it going to work in a way such as whatever we are thinking.
So that's why we built the same model.
If it is working in that field, they are going to definitely be used for the society.
The fact says that only research of bits and bits are saying that
fragile can be used for some reason and it can also be used for other users.
Nice work. You had on your interface, history, and then even some demographics in both.
How do you plan on incorporating that data into the model for research?
So actually, first of all, we build up model.
So already model has all the necessary data.
So later, we will develop the user interface.
Then whenever the user will enter, it is the data.
The main thing is the main data field is the structure.
That's the tool.
That's the tool.
That's the tool.
Actually, this is actually the new data field we developed.
This is the pre-the unwinded loading structure.
Whenever we are going to enter this input over there, once we break the system,
through the backend, it runs the model.
So it will get all the related information.
And as a result, it is going to show the recommended drug names.
Yes.
So basically, we have to .
So we basically target like these kinds of proteins.
We have bots which can also target these kinds of proteins.
So we are going to mount these drugs with these proteins and give the drug names,
existing drug names.
That's all right.
Thank you.
