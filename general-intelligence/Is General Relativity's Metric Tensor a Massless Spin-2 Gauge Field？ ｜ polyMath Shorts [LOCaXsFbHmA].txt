My name is Michael Ostroff and I'm researching vacuum general relativity or GR for short. So
it's commonly assumed that general relativity is just an effective theory which is going to
get replaced by something else. So but I'm not entirely sure that this is true. It seems to me
that general relativity has a lot of bizarre features that have gone completely unnoticed
by the scientific community and I'd like to bring light to some of them. In order to showcase that
general relativity has some extremely like peculiar properties which have gone unnoticed I'm going to
start off with what is an extremely simple example of them which I refer to as metric ambiguity. Metric
ambiguity is essentially um showing that the metric tensor in general relativity is a massless
spin to gauge field which means at any given point you can't really gain any information about the
metric tensor you only are able to see how it changes because how it changes determines what
the Levi-Savita connection is and the connection is what's actually physical. In general relativity
and well I guess differential geometry in general there's this thing called parallel transport and
you can parallel transport a tensor in this case a ring to fully covariant tensor around and you can do
it in a path and if you're able if you're able to do this in like a closed loop and it returns to its
initial um starting point then the its parallel transport is pass independent and it like so for the metric
tensor if you're using the Levi-Savita connection which has zero torsion this will automatically be
the case so long as space time is single valued and it's not multi-valued i.e. it does not have any
branch cuts so you can plug it into this equation and it will tell you essentially what the gradient of
the metric tensor is at a given point which is essentially um the partial derivative of the metric tensor
in each direction and using that um gradient of the metric tensor that tells you how it changes as you
move in like all those directions so if someone were to give you a Levi-Savita connection field um for
like a given like space time like manifold thing and they did not give you a metric tensor you might be
wondering what metric tensor goes with like created that um Levi-Savita connection field and so knowing what you
know about the um parallel transport of the metric tensor and its path independence you would plug it into
this equation like after you like guessed it at a point like at some origin and then you would parallel
transport it to every other point and in order to check that this is valid you would plug it into
the equation for the Levi-Savita connection and verify that it gives you the exact same connection
which it always will and so using so that you'll notice that your initial starting guess gives the
same Levi-Savita connection but you can change that starting guess to whatever you want and the connect
like resulting field that you're getting out of it will always be the same it'll always give you the same
Levi-Savita connection field and if you you can also change how many like time dimensions so like you
might initially have started it was like one time dimensions three spatial dimensions but you can
change like the amount of time dimensions in the metric tensor at a point by flipping like the eigenvalues
from positive to negative and so you could now have two time dimensions and two spatial dimensions and do the
same parallel transport of the metric tensor and the resulting like Levi-Savita connection field that's going
to be completely identical it doesn't really care so you could go back to one time dimension but
instead of having it like point in this direction maybe you have that time dimension pointing in this
direction and this changes like what the light cones are or because before the light cones were like um this
essentially but now well okay i guess they're like um it's hard to visualize was like 2d but like you know like
a light cone it's like this like normally in this like time dimension this is like the x and y but
like instead you could imagine like rotating it and like transforming and stuff like that um light cones
in general relativity are usually used um to think like to talk about causality and how um like past flows
into present and all that sort of stuff so if you're using the metric tensor to define like causality and like
space and time which you shouldn't because it's a gauge field then you'll essentially be able to like
randomly you can just change the amount of time dimensions to whatever amount that you want and
you can arbitrarily rotate the light cone to point in whichever directions you want and basically if you
do this then like the concept of like space and time at least like the metric defined versions of those
concepts they essentially immediately collapse because it becomes clear that the metric tensor is a
massless spin to gauge field so obviously when we look around like the world around when we look at the
world around us we see that there's three spatial dimensions and everything evolves as we go forwards
in time so what like obviously this um doesn't disprove any of that so it just proves that the metric
tensor um oh i should make i should say something real quick in the metric 10 or in general relativity
you define distances um as follows if you have a vector of like a certain length um certain values
you can multiply it by itself using the metric tensor to like define the dot product and then you have
the length square root of that vector and if you were to take the square root of that then that would
be what the length of the vector is so because the metric tensor is a gauge field um you can take a
vector at any given point in space time change the local metric tensor there to any values that you want
and you can make that um vector have any conceivable lengths that you wish like it can take on any value
whatsoever um so the concept of the metric based concept of links um also collapses um and oh yeah
geodesics still work perfectly fine because those only like care about the connection and you can have
a geodetic interval which is basically a geodesic of like a certain length and following from that
vector related stuff you can change the links of that geodetic interval to whatever you want
so and like those are also used to define proper time in gr so that also becomes like a meaningless concept
i should like um mention how this is actually like physical and like kind of observable in a way
or unobservable um might not i don't know the right word in this case there's this thing called
calusa klein theory and that's basically general relativity but um instead like usually instead it's like
five-dimensional but the fifth dimension has been curled into a circle like this um yeah this gives
rise to electromagnetism and um and like there includes a client theory there are these things
called clusa client solitons and essentially space time you know can be like knotted in like with
itself to create these um topological solitons of a vacuum space time and these behave like particles
do and so you could imagine creating a machine out of them and like maybe that machine is like doing
some work over time maybe it's um doing some calculations maybe it's observing the world around it
and um it's like acting as like an observer a potentially a conscious observer and it's going to
like regardless of the what like the like metric signature or the metric or metric tensor is like how
many space and time dimensions and which direction the light cone's pointing in it's not going to be
sensitive to that that machine is going to keep working independently of however your metric tensor
is like whatever its values are locally so it will have its own concept of time defined in ways i
don't really quite understand and it's not like i said it's not going to be sensitive to whatever the
local values of the metric tensor are so in general relativity it's known that you can take a metric tensor
field and you can multiply it by a scalar to essentially go and resize it so what might
initially have a distance distance or lengths of like one meter could now to lengths of like 10 meters
or like a nanometer or something like that and that because it doesn't change the connection like the um
levice-to-vita connection it will not change what the um vc curvature is so if it was a valid vacuum solution
prior it will still be a valid vacuum solution afterwards so that's why you can take the solutions
to like curve black holes and just resize them and scale them up however much you want and everything
works out perfectly fine this is um a known ambiguity of the metric tensor in general relativity you can
like just do this like conformal rescaling without issue and that is like um one degree of like known
metric and of what's like known already in terms of like the metric ambiguity however the metric tensor
because it's symmetric and it's like a rank 2 tensor it has n times n plus 1 divided by 2 unique components
and metric ambiguity essentially shows that each of those components are is essentially its own degree
of freedom this essentially showcases that the metric is far more ambiguous than we previously had thought
so because we can change the amount of time dimensions um usually in gr we only have one time dimension
and therefore we don't have any closed time like curves but if we had have multiple time dimensions
then you can now go in a closed loop um in like um along time like trajectories and return to your
starting point so if you can you can take any like normal space time lorenzian space time in general
relativity and add close time like curves to it and nothing will go wrong essentially because like
of the metric ambiguity because you're not changing anything because the negative eigenvalues of the metric
tensor don't actually determine what is actually time like or not because the metric tensor the gauge field
these aren't actual closed time like curves i don't know exactly what gives rise to like um the
discrepancy between time and space in general relativity but it's not um the metric tensor or it's
not its eigenvalues when most physicists say space time is doomed they mean something like very different
than this however i feel that this is the way in which like space time would actually go and collapse and
break down because our metric defined notions of space time distance and even causality essentially
have collapsed now and we need something to essentially go and replace these concepts that we can build up to
so that we can reintroduce these concepts on a higher level the higher level that we are ourselves are
operating on the level of like stars and galaxies and ducks like that kind of stuff i hope this has shown
you all that 1915's vacuum gr is a lot more peculiar than we've all been led to believe and i will be
investigating this further and if you would like to stay up to date on my research um i have a substack
account michael ostrov perpetual science and i will be regularly posting general relativity stuff on
there next time i will be talking about a little known class of complex manifolds one which is essentially
in the analytic continuation of real analytic manifolds and a like a new um a new manifold which i have
discovered which i'm dubbing the complex s one or one sphere which has some interesting properties
properties see you all next time
