There's this thing called Kaluza-Klein theory.
It's, if you have general relativity
with like extended dimensions
and you add like dimensions which are like compactified,
basically you have your like normal extended manifold
and then you have like closed manifolds
or compact spaces actually.
You product them together essentially
with like the other manifolds.
Then it creates essentially these like gauge fields.
If you do this with a one sphere,
then you get electromagnetism.
It's like normally like known as like
the 5D Kaluza-Klein theory.
So this complex one sphere,
that allows you to essentially,
if you were to product it with like Minkowski space time,
that would give you like that 5D Kaluza-Klein theory,
but now you have global coordinates.
You can plug in whatever like coordinates you want
and it should be like well-defined.
It's not like periodic coordinates
where like you go a certain distance
and then it like loops back
and you can't like plug in any values other than those.
Basically these complex Riemannian manifolds,
they allow you to get Kaluza-Klein theory
with like these,
what I feel are like more mathematically well-behaved
global coordinates.
