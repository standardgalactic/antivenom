Hi, my name is Michael Ostroff, and I'm a PhD student at FAU.
I am here today to talk to you about a type of info hazard, which are called prophetic hazards,
which can be hypothetically created by closed timelike curves.
So I believe that our universe is a sort of mathematical structure, a function to be specific.
So in this idea, spacetime is essentially a function which you can plug in various coordinates
and you get an output, which is the value of spacetime at a point.
And with a lot of functions, including spacetime, I believe, you can analytically continue it
as it abides by some sort of PDE.
And if you were to go and do this into a circle, like if it were to become multivalued
and didn't return to like the exact same value, then that would mean I would have a branch discontinuity.
A good function is single-valued, which means if you plug a like coordinate into it,
you only get like one output for the value of spacetime.
And if you were to have a system which or if you if you had a function which was single-valued everywhere,
then that would mean it would have like no branch discontinuities and it would be entire meromorphic.
And I believe that our like reality is like such a system.
I believe that our mathematical reality has none of these problematic branch cuts
or like branch discontinuities and therefore that the past evolution of spacetime
and therefore the analytic continuation of spacetime should be past independent.
This means that if you were to essentially go into a circle, you would return to your starting point.
So, if this were to be the case, then if you were to travel backwards in time,
you would be incapable of changing like the timeline and doing anything which didn't already happen in the first place.
This doesn't rule out time travel.
This only rules out self-inconsistent time travel like the grandfather paradox.
But bootstrap paradoxes are still allowed if you're preventing any like...
If time travel must be self-consistent, bootstrap paradoxes are still allowed.
So, this leads to a thought experiment that I came up with.
So, imagine you have a room and in this room there is a television screen and a camera.
When someone walks in this camera, it's connected to the television screen
such that whatever the camera sees is then displayed to the TV.
A weird thing about this thought experiment is that the signal from the camera
is not going to the TV in the present.
It's actually sending it into the past.
So, if someone were to be...
If someone were inside the room,
they would be able to see what would be going on in the room one minute in the future.
They would gain knowledge of the room's future, essentially.
So, if someone were to walk into the room
and they saw themselves doing something in the future,
they would not have any capacity to do anything
other than what they're seeing themselves do.
So, let's do a little bit of a thought experiment right now involving time travel.
Let's say we have this room
and in this room is a television and a camera.
This camera is filming what is going on inside the room
and it's sending that feed, like that information, over to the television.
However, it's not sending it to the television at like that same moment.
It's sending it backwards in time by one minute
and as a result, anyone who is inside of this room
is able to see what is going on inside this room
like one minute into the future.
So, let's say there's a door here
and someone is told like that there is this
like room with like this like closed time like curve in it.
So, like information from the like futures coming to the past.
And so, this person like walks in
and they have the mindset that they'll do
that they see themselves doing something on the screen
then they'll do it within reason.
And this person, they walk into the room
they look up at the screen
and they see themselves listening to music on their phone and dancing.
And so, they think, you know, that seems harmless enough.
I'm actually just going to go do that.
And so, then they listen to music on their phone
and they start dancing
and they're all fine and happy
and everything's perfectly fine.
And then that person ends up leaving the room.
And let's say another person
is then going to go and enter this room.
And this person has a very different mindset.
They think that they're going to go and do the opposite
of what they see themselves doing on the screen
and create a time paradox, essentially.
It's essentially like they're hoping to create
like a grandfather paradox.
So, when they walk into the room
they look at the screen
and then they see themselves doing something
which they can't control.
They see themselves like flailing on the ground
having some sort of seizure, essentially.
And when they see this on the screen
it triggers a cascade of neuronal activity
in their brain
which then initiates that seizure.
And the reason that this happened
instead of something a lot more harmless
like with the other person
was because the closed timelike curve in this room
it's sort of suppressing their ability
to do things which are inconsistent
with what's going on on the television, essentially.
And because this person
because they went into this
with the mindset that they were going to do
the opposite of what they saw on the TV
essentially this suppressed their free will
such that, like so much
to such a degree
that they did not have the free will
to actually decide any of their future actions.
and so that's why
they essentially start having a seizure on the floor.
So this is essentially what I refer to
as a prophetic hazard
and it's a sort of info hazard
that a closed timelike curve
in a self-consistent universe
like time travel-wise
should create.
Now, if you were to instead
have like painted over the television
before that individual came in
then when they like walked in
and looked at the television
it would just be black.
They wouldn't really be able to
gain any information
about their like future actions
from that like black television, essentially.
But information from the future
it's still like traveling
into the television screen.
It's still being like emitted from the LEDs.
It's then just like hitting the black paint
and getting converted into infrared radiation
and this infrared radiation
which does contain information
about this person's future actions
it's still hitting them
and but because they can't see infrared radiation
they are not able to discern any information
about their future actions
and their ability to do something
which like would create
like a grandfather paradox
or at least like attempt to do so
is greatly diminished
such that they just look at the screen
which looks completely like black to them
and they just are able to walk out of the room
completely unharmed.
So closed time-like curves
in and of themselves
like they should not inherently create a
like they shouldn't create prophetic hazards
but under the right conditions
if you're able to get coherent information
about the future from them
like specifically about your future actions
then you are your free will to do anything
other than those event-like actions
is suppressed.
Now it's possible
you could have someone
who walks into the room
and they aren't really told about
what's going on on the television
but they
so let's say they're told that
the images which are being displayed
on the television
is essentially just like some deep fake
being like automatically generated
by some sort of AI
this person then walks into the room
with no like ideas to like go and
do what they see on the TV
or do the opposite of what they see on the TV
and so when they go in
they'll just like
they don't really have the ability
to do the opposite of what they see on the TV
but they'll probably like
not try to resist doing what they see.
Okay so you can imagine
like two different scenarios to start
one where
they're like there's like a prophet
and they go and tell the truth
but like the person they're telling it
like it to
like about the future
they aren't really listening
they don't like think the prophet's legit
and so they basically just ignore them
go about their life
regardless of whatever the prophet says
and there's another scenario
when the prophet is not legit
and they're basically lying
and the person doesn't really
putting away on what the prophet says
so
in both cases
like there is like no
effect on that person's life
essentially
like we're
like depending on whatever
like the prophet says
but if that person does
believe what that prophet says
then
if you are in a prophetically hazardous
space-time
it would be best to ignore
to just like
assume
that any information you're receiving
which is allegedly
like about your future
is not accurate
and to not like act on it
because
by being willing to act on it
you
will alter the
like subset of possible
um
future realities
in a way which
like prophetic hazards
could emerge
and start to harm you
um
however
if you like
don't act on any
like knowledge
you might be receiving
from the space-time
or from the future
then it's essentially like
you've
taken like black paint
and painted over that television
and you
like there's close time
there's a close time light curve
and you are getting information
about your future
but
it's not in a way
which is actually going to be
prophetically hazardous
so this room
the one was this close time light curve
it's a prophetically hazardous space-time
because of these like
um
free will suppressing
like prophetic hazards
so
if you were in a
um
prophetically hazardous space-time
i would suggest
you don't really believe anything
you are told about your own future
you just assume that
it's false
and
if you were to do that
and you like
um
disregard
that like
future knowledge
which could be
prophetically hazardous
then what you're essentially doing
is taking a bucket of
black paint
and you're painting over
that television screen
so
the close time light curves
are still there
but you're essentially
nullifying the
like prophetic hazards
if you do take the
information from the
your future seriously
um
then that will alter
um
the subset of possible features
which you
could find yourself in
potentially
for the worse
because
the dynamics of
prophetically hazardous
space-times
are likely very different
from the dynamics of
like non-prophetically hazardous
space-times
so
it's best to
like try to
it's best to try to avoid
um
prophetic hazards
if you can
and like minimize their effects
so
if you were to ever
to come across any prophets
just don't listen to them
or don't believe them
um
so
this
weirdly enough
this might actually have
applications regarding
um
fundamental physics
weirdly enough
this stuff about
prophetic hazards
it might actually be relevant
to
um
quantum physics
to some extent
because
i was like thinking about
the
like poly's exclusion principle
and
like
Kerr black holes
and i realized that there was like
an interesting
connection
specifically
Kerr-Newman black holes
so
i realized that there is
a potential application
or relevancy
of these prophetic hazards
when it comes to
quantum mechanics
specifically
regarding
the poly exclusion principle
and
Kerr-Newman black holes
so
if you know about
like Kerr-Newman black holes
they essentially have this
ring singularity
at the center of them
which is threaded by
an electromagnetic field
so
if you were looking at
a negatively charged
Kerr-Newman black hole
it would
um
essentially be like
this
and the electric field lines
would be pointing inside
of the
like
ring singularity
um
and what this is
over here
um
the circular region
this is actually
this um
a wormhole
which leads to another
Kerr-Newman black hole
um
and that
the Kerr-Newman black hole
that it leads to
if you were to like
go through this wormhole
you would see it
um
being a Kerr-Newman black hole
of equal and opposite charge
oh
okay so
this
these black hole electrons
they're essentially
um
Kerr-Newman black holes
with the same
like mass and
um
charge and
angular momentum
as
um
electrons have
and these
um
like
black hole electrons
they're actually
they have naked singularity
so this
like
um
ringularity
and this like
wormhole region
they're actually exposed
so
they're not behind
like
they're not shielded
by any event horizons
and
if the electrons
are these
like such
like
um
soliton
like
gravitational
solitons
like this
they probably
aren't going to look
exactly like this
but it's a close enough
analog for this discussion
so
I'm thinking that
the polys
exclu-
polys exclusion principle
works as follows
if you
let's say you have an electron
and it's entangled
with another electron
um
in an
er equals
epr way
which means that
there's a
like this wormhole
is
um
okay
this electron
um
is connected to
that other electron
via these like
wormholes
and like
entanglement works
via wormholes
basically
um
because when you
uh
go through this
like um
wormhole
um
this like
ringularity
and you come out
of the other
um
like
black holes
wormhole
and you notice it
has an opposite
charge
you know that
um
there's this thing
called like
um
charge
like
parity symmetry
um
or charge
time parity
symmetry
cpt
and
if you were to
um
take an electron
and you were to
flip it
in its like
time orientation
its charge
would flip as well
and if you were to
flip it in its
spatial orientation
by mirroring it
in space
it would
its charge
would also
change as well
so
because
you're
coming out of
what appears to be
a positron to you
but it's actually
electron
you know that
you're either
being flipped
in the direction
of time
or you're being
flipped in the
direction of space
and if you're being
flipped in the
direction of space
then causally speaking
everything's like
perfectly fine
um
but you're kind of
like made out of
like antimatter now
um
that part
might not be so fine
but like causally
speaking everything's
okay
it's essentially
a non-orientable
wormhole
um
however
if you're getting
flipped in time
instead
then what would
happen is
um
you
like
this sort of
system
regarding these
two electrons
this is what I
would refer to
as a u-turn
metric
because
you're
you can essentially
go forwards in time
um
go through the wormhole
and then come out
um
having done a u-turn
through time
and then like
start traveling
into the past
and
when this happens
um
it starts creating
a bunch of these
closed time-like
curves
and
because
you
because you're
like able to
like um
change your
like orientation
in time
you're able to
travel into
your own past
and so
you in theory
could like
essentially
go through
another u-turn
metric down here
like in the past
and start going
forwards in time
again
and come back
to your original
starting point
and so
there are
like definitely
closed time-like
curves present
and
my thought is
that maybe
reality might
try to prevent
like such a thing
from occurring
and it would be
able to do this
by um
making these
like um
black hole
making these
black hole
electrons
when they're in
this configuration
um
repel each other
um
or either
like not get
close enough
that this
entanglement
happens in the
first place
so
if they
were to
repel each other
then both
of these
electrons
would start
to accelerate
um
farther and farther
away from each
other
um
and that would
keep
um
closed time-like
curves from
getting
created
essentially
the idea
is
essentially
if the universe
wants to
prevent the
creation of
prophetic hazards
then it would
essentially be
exerting these
like anti-prophetic
forces
on electrons
such that they
do not get
entangled
in a way
which creates
said prophetic
hazards
and i'm
wondering
if um
like two
electrons
sharing the
same
quantum state
would inherently
create like
um
have them
become entangled
in such a way
which creates
like those
prophetic hazards
and maybe if
they're like
um
not in the
same
quantum state
if it would
then um
just switch
the like
spatial orientation
and not create
any closed
time-like
curves
so
essentially
like to recap
this video
so far
if you have
a self
like
consistent
if you have
self-consistent
time travel
then you
get this
type of
info hazard
known as
prophetic hazards
um
which like
are created
by closed
time-like
curves
under certain
conditions
and
the universe
might want
to prevent
the
like
creation
of these
prophetic hazards
or like
closed
time-like
curves
um
which could
potentially be
created
when two
electrons
in the same
state
become
entangled
and
it does
this
like
it prevents
this creation
using
um
what
what I've
been referring
to as
like
anti-prophetic
forces
because
they
prevent
the formation
of prophetic
hazards
