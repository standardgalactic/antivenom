there's a lot known about sirtuins and there's a few people who still claim that it's debatable.
It's not really debatable. We know how these enzymes work. We know how to activate them with
small molecules, as you can see in this review by Michael Bunkowski and I. And so, you know,
I've spent a lot of my career trying to help people be healthier. So I've been co-developing
molecules that can activate these enzymes. You don't just have to fast or exercise to get the
benefits. So these enzymes, what they do in yeast and in human, in large part, is they stabilize
the epigenome and they repair broken chromosomes. And they actually physically move, we think,
between silencing and controlling genes and repairing DNA. And that's important for the
hypothesis too. But what's important about sirtuins, named after the original SIR2 gene,
SIR stands for information. And so that's obviously been driving my quest to understand
what is it about information that's relevant to aging. So this is a series of slides that I drew
in the early teens of this century. So, you know, these are ideas. These are not published.
You can see what kind of things that I was thinking about at the time.
