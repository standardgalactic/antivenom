And we could change the lifespan of a yeast cell by creating these circles of DNA or breaking
the DNA in just a few defined places that would accelerate aging, including the sterility
and the size and the slowness.
And we could do the opposite.
We could actually slow down the formation of these.
And other colleagues in the lab made mutations that prevented circles from forming as frequently.
And as the model predicted, the yeast cells lived longer and maintained their fertility.
And so that led to a real shift because at the time in the 1990s, when I arrived at MIT,
the idea was that aging was caused by damage.
So we expected in genetic screens to find antioxidant enzymes.
But instead, we found genes that controlled other genes, silencing proteins, which we now
call sirtuins.
