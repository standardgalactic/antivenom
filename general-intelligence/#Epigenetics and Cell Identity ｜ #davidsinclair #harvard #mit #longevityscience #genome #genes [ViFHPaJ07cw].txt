I'm fascinated with cell identity.
Of course, the epigenome gives cells their identity.
It's what allows development to happen.
It's how you get an embryo from a single cell.
And the idea at the time was maybe we get what I came up with at the time.
It's called epigenetic drift.
Due to insults to perhaps the chromosome, DNA breaks, circles of DNA, these distract
the epigenetic regulators.
What were once very powerful boundaries and accurate gene expression levels become smooth.
And actually, you don't get the beautiful pattern of gene expression.
And I did some mathematical modeling of that that helped my thinking.
Inspired by Claude Shannon's work, I started going nuts about analog versus digital information
and noise and the observer, which you'll see later, and started to model biological noise
in the same way that Shannon modeled informational and digital noise.
And I started to realize there were two types of information in the body.
There was digital information, which is DNA.
And a lot of the epigenome, which is just as important for life and longevity, is analog.
