Dijiste:
I wanted to do the math how long would it take for the human race to get down to six million people if everyone stopped reproducing for ten years and then after that only let one out of a thousand people have a child once per year?
ChatGPT dijo:
That's a wild and fascinating thought experiment—like something out of
Children of Men
crossed with a soft apocalypse! Let's break it into two
phases
and run the math.
Assumptions
Starting population: 8 billion (approximate current global population)
Average human lifespan: 73 years (world average; we'll round it a bit for easier modeling)
Uniform death rate per year, no major war/famine/pandemic changes
No reproduction for 10 years (Phase 1)
After that, only 1 in 1,000 people can have one child per year (Phase 2)
No children die young (we'll simplify by assuming all children survive to adulthood)
Phase 1: 10 Years of Zero Reproduction
Let's model population decline due only to aging/death.
Mortality rate estimate:
Let's simplify using an average lifespan of 73 years. That means ~1/73 of the population dies each year.
So yearly death rate:

Phase 2: Strict Reproduction Rules
Starting from ~6.9 billion people, now
1 in 1,000 people can have one child per year
. So each year, the population loses people through death but gains a very small number of births.
Let's iterate year by year to find when we reach 6 million. But first, define variables:
Let
P(t)
be the population at year
t
after the 10-year no-baby period.
Each year:
Deaths = P(t) / 73
Births = P(t) / 1000
So the yearly change is:
Δ
P
=
Births
−
Deaths
=
P
(
t
)
1000
−
P
(
t
)
73
\Delta P = \text{Births} - \text{Deaths} = \frac{P(t)}{1000} - \frac{P(t)}{73}
Δ
P
=
Births
−
Deaths
=
1000
P
(
t
)
​
−
73
P
(

)
​
This simplifies to:
Δ
P
=
P
(

)
(

1000
−
1
73
)
≈
P
(
t
)
⋅
(
−
0.0127
)
\Delta P = P(t) \left( \frac{1}{1000} - \frac{1}{73} \right) \approx P(t) \cdot (-0.0127)
Δ
P
=
P

​

≈
P

⋅
(

So we have exponential decay with a slight birth offset:
P
(
t

P
(
t
)
⋅
(
1
−
0.0127
)
=

⋅
0.9873
P(t+1) = P(t) \cdot (1 - 0.0127) = P(t) \cdot 0.9873
P

=

Final Result
It would take approximately
552 years
after the first 10 years (of no births) for the human population to fall to
6 million
, given:
Everyone stops having kids for a decade
Then only 1 in 1,000 people are allowed to have
one
child per year
Total time: ~562 years.
Want to graph it out or simulate variants with changing birth rules, lifespans, or population targets?
Dijiste:
No we are just going to automate the workforce and then when 40 billion rooms are built and the infrastructure to support them people are then recommended one child per year, how long until they again at current levels?
ChatGPT dijo:
Okay—let's flip the script. This is now a
repopulation question
with a futuristic premise:
Setup:
We've built infrastructure for
40 billion rooms
—enough to house a much larger population.
The current population is at a
post-decline low
(we'll use
6 million
, as in your earlier model).
The workforce is
fully automated
, so there's no economic barrier to growth.
Each person is recommended to have
one child per year
(presumably for a set portion of their lives).
We want to know:
How long until we return to current levels (8 billion)?
Assumptions for This Growth Phase
To keep things tractable, let's assume:
Initial population:
6,000,000
Birth rate:
1 child per person per year (we'll assume this applies only to adults aged ~18-40, for modeling purposes)
We'll use a
simplified exponential growth model
, where a consistent birth rate adds a fixed multiplier per year.
We'll also ignore death for now since the population is small and tech is presumably advanced (we can adjust this if needed).
Exponential Growth Model
In this case, the population approximately
doubles every generation
, or potentially
faster
if people are having one child per year.
Let's define:
r = average number of children per person per year
Since one child per adult per year is extremely high (way above historical peak fertility rates), we'll cap it with assumptions.
Let's try three scenarios:
Scenario A: 1 child per adult per year
Assume:
⅓ of population is childbearing (say ages 18-40)
Each childbearing person has 1 child per year
That means population grows by ~⅓ annually
So:

Human Population Growth from 6 Million
Here's a logarithmic chart showing how long it takes to grow from 6 million to 8 billion and 40 billion under three different reproduction strategies:
Dark Blue (33% growth)
hits
8 billion in ~25 years
and
40 billion in ~32 years
—incredibly rapid.
Orange (17% growth)
takes around
46 years
to reach
8 billion
, and
58 years
for
40 billion
.
Green (2% annual growth)
is far slower, hitting
8 billion in ~363 years
, and
40 billion in ~439 years
.
This gives you a visual sense of how aggressive or relaxed population policy could drastically affect repopulation speed—especially in a fully automated, infrastructure-ready world.

Just explain it in common language
ChatGPT dijo:
Absolutely—here's the simple version:
Let's say humanity has dropped to just
6 million people
—and we've built the infrastructure for
40 billion rooms
to prepare for a big comeback. We've also automated all work, so survival is no longer tied to jobs. Now we just need to decide
how fast we repopulate
.
We looked at three scenarios:
1. Fastest Option
-
Everyone has 1 child per year
Population grows like wildfire.
We hit
8 billion people in about 25 years
We reach
40 billion in just 32 years
That's about one generation of explosive growth. Think
super-baby boom
.
2. Moderate Option
-
Everyone has 1 child every 2 years
Still very fast.
We get back to
8 billion in about 46 years
,
40 billion in about 58 years
That's a few generations, but still a quick ramp-up.
3. Slow & Steady
-
Just 2% growth per year
Much more like how population grows in stable countries today.
It would take
363 years to reach 8 billion
And
439 years to reach 40 billion
So What Does This Mean?
If you let people have kids at a high rate—and you've got the infrastructure to support it—
humanity could fully repopulate Earth (and then some) in just a few decades.
But if we go slow and steady, it becomes a
multi-century project
, which might feel more sustainable and controlled.
You could think of this like planting a garden:
Fast option
: Toss seeds everywhere and water daily—you get a jungle fast.
Moderate
: Plant carefully, give it time—you get a stable, thriving orchard.
Slow
: Plant a tree a year—great for the long-term, but slow to fill the space.
Want to explore what life might be like in each phase? Or how culture, education, and relationships would adapt to this regrowth?
