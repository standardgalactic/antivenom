extus Empiricus (Ancient Greek: Σέξτος Ἐμπειρικός, Sextos Empeirikos; fl. mid-late 2nd century AD) was a Greek Pyrrhonist philosopher and Empiric school physician with Roman citizenship. His philosophical works are the most complete surviving account of ancient Greek and Roman Pyrrhonism, and because of the arguments they contain against the other Hellenistic philosophies, they are also a major source of information about those philosophies.

Little is known about Sextus Empiricus. He likely lived in Alexandria, Rome, or Athens.[1] His Roman name, Sextus, implies he was a Roman citizen.[2] The Suda, a 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, states that he was the same person as Sextus of Chaeronea,[3] as do other pre-modern sources, but this identification is commonly doubted.[4] In his medical work, as reflected by his name, tradition maintains that he belonged to the Empiric school in which Pyrrhonism was popular. However, at least twice in his writings, Sextus seems to place himself closer to the Methodic school.

Philosophy
edit
Main article: Pyrrhonism
As a skeptic, Sextus Empiricus raised concerns which applied to all types of knowledge. He doubted the validity of induction[5] long before its best known critic David Hume, and raised the regress argument against all forms of reasoning:

Those who claim for themselves to judge the truth are bound to possess a criterion of truth. This criterion, then, either is without a judge's approval or has been approved. But if it is without approval, whence comes it that it is trustworthy? For no matter of dispute is to be trusted without judging. And, if it has been approved, that which approves it, in turn, either has been approved or has not been approved, and so on ad infinitum.[6]

This view is known as Pyrrhonian skepticism, which Sextus differentiated from Academic skepticism as practiced by Carneades which, according to Sextus, denies the possibility of knowledge altogether, something that Sextus criticized as being an affirmative belief. Instead, Sextus advocates simply giving up belief; in other words, suspending judgment (epoché) about whether or not anything is knowable.[7] Only by suspending judgment can we attain a state of ataraxia (roughly, 'peace of mind').

There is some debate as to the extent to which Sextus advocated the suspension of judgement. According to Myles Burnyeat,[8] Jonathan Barnes,[9] and Benson Mates,[10] Sextus advises that we should suspend judgment about virtually all beliefs; that is to say, we should neither affirm any belief as true nor deny any belief as false, since we may live without any beliefs, acting by habit. Michael Frede, however, defends a different interpretation,[11] according to which Sextus does allow beliefs, so long as they are not derived by reason, philosophy or speculation; a skeptic may, for example, accept common opinions in the skeptic's society. The important difference between the skeptic and the dogmatist is that the skeptic does not hold his beliefs as a result of rigorous philosophical investigation

Great summary! Here's a cleaned-up, more concise version of your text that retains all the essential points while improving clarity and flow:
Sextus Empiricus
(Ancient Greek: Σέξτος Ἐμπειρικός; fl. mid-late 2nd century AD) was a Greek Pyrrhonist philosopher and physician of the Empiric school, holding Roman citizenship. His works are the most complete surviving accounts of ancient Greek and Roman
Pyrrhonism
, and they serve as major sources of information on other Hellenistic philosophies due to his critiques of them.
Life
Little is known about Sextus' personal life. He likely lived in
Alexandria
,
Rome
, or
Athens
. His Roman name,
Sextus
, suggests he was a Roman citizen. The
Suda
, a 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, identifies him with
Sextus of Chaeronea
, though this is widely doubted. While tradition places him in the
Empiric school
of medicine, some of his writings hint at an affinity with the
Methodic school
.
Philosophy
Sextus was a central figure in
Pyrrhonian skepticism
, which questions the possibility of certain knowledge. He challenged
inductive reasoning
and famously presented the
regress argument
, where any justification requires another justification, leading to an infinite regress:
"Those who claim to judge the truth must possess a criterion. But if that criterion itself needs justification, and so on, this leads to an infinite regress, undermining the trustworthiness of any claim."
Sextus distinguished
Pyrrhonian skepticism
from
Academic skepticism
(like that of
Carneades
), which outright denies the possibility of knowledge. Sextus argued that even denying knowledge is a belief and thus, not truly skeptical. Instead, he advocated
epoché
—the suspension of judgment—leading to
ataraxia
(tranquility or peace of mind).
There is debate about how far Sextus pushed this suspension. Scholars like
Burnyeat
,
Barnes
, and
Mates
suggest he advised suspending judgment about nearly all beliefs, living by habit rather than reasoned convictions.
Michael Frede
, however, argues that Sextus allowed practical beliefs derived from societal norms, as long as they were not rooted in philosophical speculation.

I just thought it interesting it reminded my of Feyerebrand
ChatGPT dijo:
That's a sharp connection—and a really interesting one!
Sextus Empiricus and
Paul Feyerabend
both challenged the idea of fixed, rational methods as foundations of knowledge. Sextus, through Pyrrhonian skepticism, advocated for
epoché
(suspension of judgment) to achieve
ataraxia
, arguing that we can't ultimately justify our beliefs. Feyerabend, in
Against Method
, argued that
"anything goes"
in science—there's no universal method, and progress often involves breaking the rules.
Both were basically calling out the dogmatism in systems claiming to know "the truth," whether philosophical or scientific.
Feyerabend even cites Sextus in some of his work, seeing skepticism as a necessary tool against scientific authoritarianism. In a way, you could say Feyerabend updated Sextus for the modern scientific world.
Were you thinking of a particular aspect of Feyerabend's ideas when Sextus came to mind?
Dijiste:
His argument that the sciences were overly formalized in that they cannot predict what they will discover and the serendipity leads to innovation, and that Intuition is needed at a step before scientific inquiry.
ChatGPT dijo:
Exactly—that's a deep parallel with Sextus.
Feyerabend's critique that science is overly formalized resonates strongly with Sextus' view that
reasoning and dogma can't be trusted as ultimate guides
. Where Sextus suspends judgment because no belief system holds up under scrutiny, Feyerabend suspends
methodological orthodoxy
, arguing that rigid scientific method stifles creativity and discovery. For both,
the system isn't sacred
—and
intuition, experience, and context
become central.
Feyerabend saw
serendipity and intuition
not as accidents but as essential
preconditions
for discovery—things that arise outside the bounds of formal rules. Sextus, too, allowed for
living according to appearances, customs, and habits
, even though no ultimate justification was offered. Both were
anti-foundationalist
, in that knowledge doesn't need a fixed, rational bedrock to be usable or valuable.
It's kind of cool to think of Sextus as an ancient ally of post-positivist science critiques. You might even say Sextus'
epoché
is a philosophical ancestor to Feyerabend's
epistemological anarchy
.
Are you thinking of pulling these ideas together for a paper or just exploring the vibe between the two?

Adversus Mathematicos I-VI is sometimes distinguished from Adversus Mathematicos VII-XI by using another title, Against the Dogmatists (Πρὸς δογματικούς, Pros dogmatikous) and then the remaining books are numbered as I-II, III-IV, and V, despite the fact that it is commonly inferred that what we have is just part of a larger work whose beginning is missing and it is unknown how much of the total work has been lost. The supposed general title of this partially lost work is Skeptical Treatises' (Σκεπτικὰ Ὑπομνήματα/Skeptika Hypomnēmata).[15]

Book	English title	Greek title
VII-VIII	Against the Logicians	Πρὸς λογικούς / Pros logikous
IX-X	Against the Physicists	Πρὸς φυσικούς / Pros Physikous
XI	Against the Ethicists	Πρὸς ἠθικούς / Pros Ethikous

That's a great addition—it really highlights how fragmented and complex Sextus' legacy is, and how later scholars had to piece it together like a philosophical puzzle.
Here's a clean breakdown of that second part of
Adversus Mathematicos

Against the Dogmatists
, which may be part of the larger (and partially lost)

Interesting that these later books deal with
core branches of philosophy
—logic, physics (in the ancient metaphysical sense), and ethics—which were central to the
Stoics, Epicureans, and Aristotelians
, i.e., the dogmatists Pyrrhonists were reacting against.
Also, that incomplete nature of the work leaves us in a kind of permanent epoché ourselves—
we can't even be sure how much Sextus really wrote or intended!
Almost poetic.
