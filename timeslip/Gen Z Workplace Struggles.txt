According to Fortune.com, Gen Zers are the worst people to hire and so far, based on reports,[6 in 10 employers are already handing them](https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.msn.com%2Fen-us%2Fmoney%2Fcareersandeducation%2Fbosses-are-firing-gen-z-grads-just-months-after-hiring-them-here-s-what-they-say-needs-to-change%2Far-AA1xZfHI%3Focid%3Dmsedgdhp%26pc%3DHCTS%26cvid%3D27b10875c5024982beea18298beb1f13%26ei%3D4) their walking papers soon after hiring the fresh out of college crowd. 1 in 6 bosses will probably never hire a recent grad again. **What is going on here?**
The term Gen Z refers to individuals born between 1997 and 2012, a period characterized by significant technological advancements and the emergence of social media platforms. This generation often experienced television as a *primary* source of entertainment. Gen Z tends to communicate less when addressed and prefers indoor activities over playing outside with friends.
Yes.
*That* generation.
As harsh as this may sound, this generation of college grads, are not particularly groomed for the workplace. They were able to make it through all grade levels and college, but unfortunately, the results of home life and school life, equates to a bunch of grads not worth hiring.
"Three-quarters of the companies surveyed said some or all of their recent graduate hires were unsatisfactory in some way."

This article seems suspicious. How has this not been a complaint of every generation?
ChatGPT dijo:
Exactly — you're picking up on a classic pattern.
Every generation that enters the workforce gets criticized by the ones already there. It's basically a rite of passage. Boomers were called lazy by their parents. Gen X were seen as cynical slackers. Millennials were labeled entitled and overly sensitive. Now Gen Z is getting the same treatment — just with different buzzwords like "unprofessional" or "unwilling to work."
What's really happening here is a mix of:
Cultural Shift
: Each generation brings new values and expectations, especially around work-life balance, mental health, and purpose-driven careers. Older generations often see this as rebellion rather than evolution.
Technology Gap
: Gen Z grew up with the internet, smartphones, and AI. Their communication style and workflow are very different — and sometimes misunderstood as disrespectful or lazy when it's just... different.
Structural Change
: The workplace is evolving fast — remote work, gig economy, automation. Gen Z is entering a very different world than past generations, and many companies are still adapting.
So yeah — the article touches on real tensions, but it frames them in a very "blame Gen Z" way instead of seeing the bigger picture.
Want a breakdown of how these complaints have repeated through the decades? It's kind of hilarious when you line them up.
Dijiste:
Yeah sure
ChatGPT dijo:
Alright, here's a quick breakdown of workplace complaints about each generation when
they
were the new kids on the block — you'll start seeing the pattern real fast:
1920s-1940s: The Silent Generation
Complaint:
"They're too conformist. They don't challenge authority."
Reality:
Grew up in war and depression. Valued stability and hierarchy. Employers actually complained they weren't innovative enough.
1950s-1960s: Baby Boomers
Complaint:
"They're self-absorbed, question authority too much, and are obsessed with personal fulfillment."
Reality:
Came of age during civil rights and Vietnam protests. Pushed for change in rigid corporate cultures. Wanted meaning
and
money.
1970s-1980s: Gen X
Complaint:
"They're cynical, lazy, and uncommitted. They lack work ethic."
Reality:
Grew up with latchkey childhoods, economic recessions, and mistrust of institutions. Valued independence and flexibility over blind loyalty to corporations.
1990s-2000s: Millennials
Complaint:
"They're entitled, overly sensitive, need constant praise, and want promotions without hard work."
Reality:
Entered the job market during the Great Recession, faced record student debt, and challenged outdated work norms. Also popularized work-life balance and remote work.
2010s-2020s: Gen Z
Complaint:
"They're unprofessional, unwilling to work hard, can't take feedback, and care more about TikTok than teamwork."
Reality:
Raised on tech, deeply value mental health and social impact, and are navigating a rapidly changing economy (AI, climate anxiety, political instability). They're not lazy — they're strategic and skeptical.
So yeah, the complaints are basically on repeat — just swapped out with modern language. It's less about generational "flaws" and more about change being uncomfortable for the people already in power.
Want me to turn this into a slick little graphic or post? Would make a fun share.
