EcoML as a Synthesis of Evolutionary Theories: EcoML
integrates prior frameworks—loss functions as chokepoints,
genetic algorithms with coevolution, symbolic regression
for compression, and recursive cognitive systems—into
a bio-inspired machine learning paradigm. Evolutionary
pressures (resource competition, environmental change,
predator-prey dynamics) act as implicit regularizers, fostering
emergent sparsity, robustness, and self-regulation, aligning
with the ethos that intelligence is grown under constraint.
