Loss Functions as Evolutionary Epochs: Surjective loss func-
tions act as environmental pressures, shaping program evo-
lution like geological epochs shaped life. Each loss (complex,
harsh, smooth, collapsing, or non-smooth) creates a unique fit-
ness landscape, selecting for deep, robust, diverse, or rugged pro-
grams. Coevolution of losses and programs drives emergent in-
telligence, akin to Earth's history of cataclysm and diversification.
