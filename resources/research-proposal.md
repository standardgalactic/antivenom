# A Proposal to Enhance Theoretical Rigor in Economics via Geometric–Thermodynamic Diagnostics

## 1.0 Introduction: Addressing the Crisis of Comprehension

Across the modern sciences, a paradox has emerged: our mathematical formalisms have grown increasingly sophisticated, yet our comprehension of what their symbols truly denote has often declined.
In fundamental physics, speculative architectures like string theory proliferate, largely decoupled from empirical verification.
In artificial intelligence, transformer models achieve remarkable predictive success while remaining interpretively opaque.
This same dynamic is present in **Economics**, where highly abstract models of rational agents often diverge from the bounded, messy reality of market behavior.

This “crisis of comprehension” is not a failure of mathematics, but an **erosion of the essential coupling between abstract representation and the measurable world.** This proposal introduces a novel, rigorously grounded framework to diagnose and remedy this decoupling.

The central objective of this research is to apply the **Typology of Theoretical Failure**—a diagnostic framework grounded in information geometry and the thermodynamics of computation, previously tested in domains such as fundamental physics and Lacanian psychoanalytic theory—to the field of Economics.
By modeling theories and empirical data as distinct mathematical manifolds, this framework quantifies the *energetic cost* of maintaining a coherent mapping between them, thereby transforming the abstract virtue of rigor into a measurable property.

Applying this framework to prominent economic models will yield a quantitative, objective toolkit for evaluating theoretical robustness, resolving long-standing methodological debates, and guiding the development of more empirically grounded and resilient theories.
By moving beyond qualitative critique to quantitative diagnostics, we can identify specific failure modes—such as scope inflation or definitional circularity—that currently inhibit progress.

## 2.0 The Diagnostic Framework: A Geometric and Thermodynamic Approach to Rigor

The **Typology of Theoretical Failure** reframes scientific understanding not as a static possession of knowledge, but as a dynamic, measurable, energetic process.
It provides a universal language for describing how theories succeed or fail in maintaining a coherent, efficient correspondence with reality.

At its core:

* Each theory is modeled as a **mathematical manifold** *(M<sub>T</sub>)* defined by its primitive variables (e.g., utility, capital, elasticity).
* The empirical world—the domain of observable data—is modeled as another manifold *(M<sub>R</sub>)* with measurable coordinates (e.g., GDP, inflation, prices).
* A theory’s explanatory power is captured by the **mapping**
  *f : M<sub>R</sub> → M<sub>T</sub>*,
  whose quality reflects the health of theoretical coupling.

This approach is grounded in the **Relativistic Scalar–Vector Plenum (RSVP)** framework, which models persistent systems—from galaxies to cognitive structures—as information-processing fields.

### Core Measures of Theoretical Health

The health of this mapping is assessed through three measurable properties ensuring that the *Work of Understanding* remains finite and productive:

1. **Injectivity** — `det(JᵀJ) > 0`
   Ensures that distinct real-world situations are not collapsed into identical theoretical symbols.
   Preserves informational distinctness.

2. **Phase Coherence** — bounded `|∇φ|²`
   Represents sustained alignment between theoretical predictions and empirical observations over time.

3. **Thermodynamic Feasibility** — `W ≥ kB T ΔS`
   Guarantees that the energetic cost of comprehension is finite and physically plausible.

### The Epistemic Energy Functional

These are unified into a single scalar metric:

```
R[f, φ] = α det(JᵀJ) − β |∇φ|² − γ ΔS
```

A theory maximizing **R** maintains the strongest, most sustainable coupling between mathematical formalism and the reality it models.
When any criterion fails, a theory enters one of several identifiable **failure modes**.

### Table 1. Typology of Theoretical Failure

| **Failure Mode**              | **Description**                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dimensional Incoherence**   | Theoretical quantities lack defined units, rendering the Jacobian (and thus reality coupling) undefined.                                                 |
| **Empirical Inaccessibility** | The validation domain lies beyond possible observation or experiment, making M<sub>R</sub> undefined and the theory untestable.                          |
| **Scope Inflation**           | The model is extended into domains where its assumptions fail, causing incoherence and an increased entropic cost of comprehension.                      |
| **The Elegance Fallacy**      | Aesthetic beauty is mistaken for truth, yielding a theory that ignores thermodynamic infeasibility *(W < kB T ΔS)* and accumulates hidden entropic debt. |

## 3.0 Research Questions and Objectives

### Primary Research Question

> **Can the geometric–thermodynamic framework systematically identify and quantify the modes of theoretical failure in prominent models within Economics?**

### Specific Objectives

1. **Model Manifold Reconstruction**
   Formally reconstruct competing economic theories—such as General Equilibrium Theory and Prospect Theory—as manifolds *(M<sub>T</sub>)* and their empirical counterparts *(M<sub>R</sub>)*.

2. **Diagnostic Evaluation**
   Apply the diagnostic suite to each model, testing for the eight failure modes: mapping ambiguity, definitional circularity, scope inflation, etc.

3. **Comparative Rigor Mapping**
   Synthesize findings into a **Rigor Matrix** and **Comparative Entropy Map**, visualizing the interpretive energy required to sustain each theory.

4. **Methodological Prescription**
   Develop concrete, evidence-based recommendations for strengthening theoretical rigor and fostering thermodynamically sustainable model design.

## 4.0 Proposed Methodology

The methodology deploys the diagnostic framework in three structured phases, moving from model selection to quantitative analysis and comparative synthesis.

### 4.1 Phase 1: Model Selection and Manifold Reconstruction

* Select 3–5 influential economic models based on impact, policy relevance, and data availability.
* Identify each model’s **primitive variables** (e.g., rational preference, discount rate) and corresponding **empirical observables** (e.g., consumer choice, interest rates).
* Construct explicit **Mapping Tables** documenting the relationship between theoretical and real-world quantities.

### 4.2 Phase 2: Application of the Diagnostic Toolkit

* Conduct **qualitative operational diagnostics**:

  * Dimensional audit for unit consistency.
  * Notation audit for syntactic overloading.
* Perform **quantitative geometric-thermodynamic diagnostics**:

  * Compute the Jacobian of the theory-reality mapping to test **injectivity**.
  * Measure **phase coherence** by comparing simulations to empirical time-series data.
  * Evaluate **entropy balance** to determine interpretive cost and feasibility.

### 4.3 Phase 3: Synthesis and Comparative Analysis

* Aggregate diagnostic results into a **Rigor Matrix**, producing a weighted index of theoretical health for each model.
* Visualize results via **Comparative Entropy Maps**, revealing systemic patterns of failure or resilience.
* Deliver constructive insights identifying robust theoretical architectures and recurrent failure pathologies.

## 6.0 Conclusion: Towards a Conservation Law of Meaning

This proposal addresses a fundamental challenge in modern science—the decoupling of sophisticated mathematical formalism from empirical reality.
It presents a **geometric–thermodynamic framework** capable of diagnosing this decoupling by quantifying the energetic cost of comprehension.

Our research plan systematically applies this framework to Economics to measure the rigor of its most influential models and chart a path toward more resilient theory-building.

Ultimately, rigor is not a stylistic choice but an **energetic equilibrium**:

* A **healthy theory** behaves as a *non-equilibrium steady state*, efficiently converting empirical uncertainty into structured understanding.
* A **failing theory** becomes a *dissipative structure*, consuming resources to generate more heat than light.

This project thus represents a step toward a **thermodynamic ethics of inquiry**—a standard ensuring that our theories are not merely elegant or persuasive, but sustainably and efficiently connected to the world they seek to describe.
