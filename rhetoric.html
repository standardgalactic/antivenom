<p>The chapter “Divine Right” introduces Sam Altman, the co-founder of
OpenAI, and his relationship with Elon Musk. In 2015, Musk was concerned
about the potential existential threat posed by artificial general
intelligence (AGI). He had previously invested in DeepMind Technologies
to monitor its progress and warned against Google’s acquisition of
DeepMind due to fears that it could lead to an AGI pursuing
self-interest at humanity’s expense.</p>
<p>At this time, Musk hosted dinners with like-minded individuals to
discuss ways to counter the potential dangers of AI. One such dinner
took place in June 2015, organized by Sam Altman, where Musk and other
future OpenAI leaders gathered at a private restaurant on Sand Hill Road
in Silicon Valley. The group included Altman, Greg Brockman, Dario
Amodei, and Ilya Sutskever.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the dinner was to explore the creation of a
nonprofit organization focused on developing AGI for humanity’s benefit,
as opposed to allowing Google or another corporation to control such
powerful technology. The attendees were united in their belief that an
open, collaborative approach would yield safer outcomes than a closed,
proprietary system.</p>
<p>The group proposed a governance structure with Altman and Musk as
co-chairs of the board, alongside three other members to be selected
later. The technology itself would belong to a foundation and be used
for “the good of the world,” with decisions on its application made by
the five-person board if not immediately apparent.</p>
<p>The chapter highlights how Altman’s ambition and strategic acumen
helped him gather influential figures in AI research and development,
ultimately leading to the formation of OpenAI. However, as the
organization evolved, tensions between Altman and Musk would arise,
causing a shift in Altman’s stance on AI’s potential dangers for public
consumption.</p>
<p>The text describes the founding of OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial
intelligence (AI) research lab, and its early challenges. The
co-founders are Greg Brockman, an engineer and startup expert, and Ilya
Sutskever, an AI researcher from Google. They are joined by Elon Musk
and Sam Altman, who provide funding and support.</p>
<p>The initial concept behind OpenAI is to create a nonprofit lab
focused on developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), which aims
to replicate human-level intelligence in machines. This ambitious goal
sets them apart from other tech giants like Google and Facebook, which
are primarily focused on commercial applications of AI.</p>
<p>Brockman takes the lead in recruiting top talent for OpenAI by
reaching out to leading figures in the field and inviting a group of
potential candidates to discuss their concerns about joining the new
lab. Despite initial hesitation from some researchers, nearly all accept
his offer within weeks.</p>
<p>The decision to position OpenAI as a nonprofit and emphasize
transparency is strategic, as they seek to differentiate themselves from
corporate-backed AI labs like DeepMind (acquired by Google) and to avoid
being associated with potential military applications of AI. This stance
helps attract supporters who are wary of the ethical implications of
commercializing AI research.</p>
<p>However, OpenAI’s initial strategy faces criticism from within and
outside the organization. Timnit Gebru, an AI researcher, pens a
scathing open letter expressing concerns about the lack of diversity
among the founders and the potential negative impacts of unrestricted
AGI development on marginalized communities.</p>
<p>Dario Amodei, another AI researcher, joins OpenAI in 2016 after
publishing a foundational paper on AI safety, focusing on preventing
“accidents” or harmful behaviors resulting from poorly designed
real-world AI systems. This work aligns with the existential threat
framework that has gained traction within the effective altruism
movement.</p>
<p>As OpenAI grows, internal disagreements arise over the scope of their
research priorities. Some employees, including Deborah Raji and other
women of color at the company, push for a broader definition of AI
safety that includes addressing discriminatory impacts of deep learning
models. However, executive leadership resists this expansion of
focus.</p>
<p>In 2018, the Amodei siblings become increasingly concerned with what
they perceive as OpenAI’s deviation from its original mission and form a
rival AI lab called Anthropic, taking key staff members with them. This
schism contributes to tensions within the field and affects the
development and release of major AI projects like ChatGPT.</p>
<p>The text describes the challenges and changes OpenAI faced in its
pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) while maintaining a
nonprofit structure. Initially, co-founder Elon Musk brought significant
financial support and visibility to the organization, but his
unpredictable behavior and demands for progress created a high-stress
environment. In 2016, OpenAI spent over $7 million on compensation and
benefits, with no clear management structure or priorities. The lab’s
burn rate was alarming, and tensions arose when employees were sometimes
fired without warning.</p>
<p>As DeepMind gained prominence with its AlphaGo program, Musk became
increasingly impatient, which exacerbated the situation. He would set
unrealistic deadlines, causing frustration among researchers who
believed in a more collaborative approach to AI development. This
atmosphere of pressure and secrecy led some employees, including
co-founder Sam Altman, to question whether OpenAI was living up to its
initial ideals of transparency and openness.</p>
<p>In response to these issues, OpenAI underwent significant changes. In
2019, it introduced a “capped-profit” structure, transforming itself
into a partially for-profit entity with mission-aligned investors. This
move allowed the organization to secure long-term resources and follow
what its leadership termed “OpenAI’s Law,” prioritizing rapid progress
over careful deliberation. The new strategy emphasized staying ahead of
competitors, which in turn justified consuming vast amounts of compute
power and data, often without regard for environmental or ethical
implications.</p>
<p>The organization’s co-founder and then-CTO Greg Brockman saw the need
to be first in AGI development as crucial to its mission. He believed
that falling behind would render OpenAI irrelevant, forcing it to bend
history towards beneficial AI. However, this relentless pursuit of
leadership came at a cost. Employees reported feeling immense pressure
and burnout due to the intense competitiveness and constant demand for
more funding.</p>
<p>OpenAI’s new direction also raised questions about its commitment to
transparency, openness, and collaboration—the very principles it was
founded upon. Critics argued that the organization’s focus on secrecy
and rapid progress undermined these values. In 2020, MIT Technology
Review published an article highlighting this disconnect between
OpenAI’s public image and its internal operations, further fueling
debates about the organization’s true motivations and priorities.</p>
<p>In summary, OpenAI’s journey to develop AGI has been marked by
significant challenges, including financial pressures, management
issues, and a growing divide between its stated ideals and actual
practices. The organization’s decision to transform into a partially
for-profit entity with mission-aligned investors reflected its desire to
secure long-term resources and maintain a competitive edge in the race
for AGI development. However, this shift has sparked controversy and
raised questions about OpenAI’s commitment to transparency, openness,
and collaboration in AI research.</p>
<p>The text discusses the history and implications of Artificial
Intelligence (AI), with a focus on the marketing strategies, scientific
debates, and societal impacts surrounding AI development. The term
“Artificial Intelligence” was coined as a more evocative phrase to
garner interest in a field that initially struggled for attention. This
name choice has perpetuated anthropomorphizing of AI capabilities,
leading to exaggerated expectations and fears about the technology’s
potential.</p>
<p>The development of AI has been shaped by competing scientific
theories: connectionism (focusing on learning) and symbolism (focusing
on symbolic representations). Early AI research was dominated by
symbolists, but the success of neural networks in the late 20th century
led to a resurgence of interest in connectionist methods. This shift was
facilitated by Geoffrey Hinton’s improvements to deep learning through
backpropagation and multi-layered neural networks, which enabled the
creation of “deep” neural networks.</p>
<p>The first era of AI commercialization (2012-2022) saw deep learning’s
growth fueled by corporate investments and interests. Tech companies
like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook dominated funding, shaping research
agendas and driving technological advancements. This commercial focus
led to the rise of surveillance capitalism, where user data is collected
for training AI models, generating revenue through targeted advertising
and personalized services.</p>
<p>As corporate investments in AI grew exponentially, academic research
became increasingly influenced by these priorities. Professors and
students shifted towards deep learning-focused projects due to better
funding opportunities, leading to a narrowing of diverse ideas within AI
research. Meanwhile, the limitations of neural networks—such as their
unreliability, unpredictability, and inability to reason
effectively—became more apparent, raising concerns about safety,
security, and ethical implications.</p>
<p>The text highlights several issues with deep learning models: their
susceptibility to edge-case failures (e.g., misidentifying objects or
people), the “black box” problem of opaque decision-making processes,
and biases that can perpetuate discriminatory outcomes. These challenges
have been exacerbated by scaling up models, as more data and
computational power do not necessarily solve these fundamental problems
but rather amplify their consequences in sensitive applications like
healthcare or law enforcement.</p>
<p>In summary, the text explores how AI’s marketing origins,
commercialization, and academic alignment with corporate interests have
led to a narrow focus on deep learning, despite its known limitations.
This has resulted in various societal implications, including concerns
about reliability, security, ethics, and the widening gap between AI
capabilities and human understanding. The text emphasizes the need for
diverse approaches in AI research beyond scaling up neural networks to
address these challenges effectively.</p>
<p>The text describes the evolution of OpenAI, a leading artificial
intelligence research organization, and its leadership dynamics. The
company was founded with a mission to develop beneficial AI that
benefits humanity, but as it grew, tensions arose among key figures,
leading to divisions within the company.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Sam Altman’s Vision:</strong> Sam Altman, co-founder and
CEO of OpenAI, envisioned the organization as a dominant force in AI
research. He adopted a winner-takes-all mentality from his time at Y
Combinator (YC), pushing for 10x improvements over competitors across
four categories: technical results, compute power, funding, and
preparation (safety). Altman aimed to secure Microsoft as a major
partner due to their powerful supercomputers. He also advocated for less
transparency in research publications and model deployments to protect
against infohazards and maintain a perception of superiority.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dario Amodei’s AI Safety Focus:</strong> Dario Amodei,
co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer (CSO), prioritized AI safety due
to concerns about the potential dangers of advanced AI systems. He led
efforts in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to guide
models toward positive content generation. However, his centralization
of compute resources for Nest’s work on GPT-3 and deprioritizing other
projects caused friction with other leaders like Ilya Sutskever, who
felt marginalized in terms of resources and visibility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ilya Sutskever’s Research Focus:</strong> Ilya Sutskever,
OpenAI’s chief scientist, focused on advancing AI capabilities through
large-scale models like GPT series. He collaborated with Jakub Pachocki
and Szymon Sidor to develop increasingly powerful language models.
However, his perceived naivety regarding security concerns led him to
propose a secure containment facility to protect model weights from
theft or misuse.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Growing Paranoia and Security Measures:</strong> As
OpenAI grew more successful, paranoia increased about intellectual
property theft by corporate rivals or foreign governments. The company
implemented stricter security measures, including insider threat
prevention, cybersecurity software, and physical enhancements to its
office facilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Emergence of Company “Clans”:</strong> As tensions grew
between leaders with different priorities (exploration vs. safety),
three distinct groups, or “clans,” emerged within OpenAI: Exploratory
Research, Safety, and Startup. Each clan had its own values and
objectives, contributing to a perceived divide in the company’s
culture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Ascension Project:</strong> The Nest team, led by
Amodei, worked on increasingly larger language models (GPT-2, GPT-3)
while addressing hardware and data challenges at each scale. This
project reinforced their belief in scaling laws’ applicability to
large-scale AI systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Commercialization Efforts:</strong> Altman and Brockman
developed a plan for commercializing OpenAI’s technology, resulting in
the formation of an Applied division led by Mira Murati. This division
focused on creating APIs and product integrations that allowed external
companies to leverage GPT-3’s capabilities without direct access to its
model weights.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The text highlights how OpenAI’s rapid growth, combined with
differing leadership priorities, led to internal tensions and the
emergence of distinct factions within the organization. These divisions
centered on contrasting views regarding AI safety, exploration
vs. commercialization, and resource allocation—ultimately impacting the
company’s culture and decision-making processes as it strove to develop
powerful AI systems while addressing potential risks and maintaining its
competitive edge.</p>
<p>OpenAI’s 2021 Research Road Map outlined their strategy for scaling
up their language models, specifically GPT-3, and developing multimodal
capabilities. The roadmap focused on three main objectives to achieve a
“vastly more capable” system than previously available:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Scaling GPT-3 by another 10x using a new supercomputer from
Microsoft with 18,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs.</li>
<li>Increasing compute efficiency by 25x to extract the maximum
processing power from existing chips.</li>
<li>Improving training data quality and quantity through user data
integration and reinforcement learning from human feedback.</li>
</ol>
<p>The roadmap emphasized the importance of this approach for both
scientific advancement (attaining breakthroughs in meta-learning,
reasoning, and multimodal capabilities) and commercial success
(developing products with superior capabilities). It acknowledged that
scaling alone would not provide sufficient progress, necessitating
improvements in methods to achieve greater gains.</p>
<p>The roadmap suggested several methods for achieving these goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distillation: creating smaller models from larger ones.</li>
<li>Data filtering: identifying the most impactful data subsets.</li>
<li>Sparsity: developing lighter, more efficient neural network
models.</li>
<li>Reasoning and active learning: iterative human annotation of crucial
dataset parts to improve model performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The roadmap also called for exploratory research into new algorithms
and techniques to better understand deep learning’s underlying science,
as well as the search for a groundbreaking “breakthrough system” that
could provide a new development path.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, OpenAI’s Applied division focused on productizing their
models by developing infrastructure to support user-based services and
formulating pricing strategies. They also faced challenges in defining
acceptable behaviors within their products and creating mechanisms to
prevent abuse and misuse, such as content moderation filters for GPT-3
outputs. These efforts were often ad hoc and patchy, with limited
guarantees on safety and security, leading to concerns from employees
about the quality and potential dangers of OpenAI’s technology.</p>
<p>The text discusses the experiences of workers involved in content
moderation for AI projects, focusing on Mophat Okinyi’s involvement with
OpenAI through Sama. Here’s a detailed summary and explanation of the
key points:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Background on Okinyi</strong>: Mophat Okinyi is a Kenyan
man living in Nairobi who accepted a content moderation project for
OpenAI via Sama, an AI training company. He was initially drawn to the
opportunity due to financial necessity and the prospect of a better
future.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Project Details</strong>: The project involved annotating
text-based sexual content into categories defined by OpenAI, ranging
from descriptions of child sexual abuse to erotic content that could be
illegal in the US if performed in real life. Some of this content was
scraped from dark internet sites or generated by AI prompts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact on Okinyi’s Mental Health</strong>: As Okinyi
reviewed increasingly graphic and disturbing content, his mental health
began to deteriorate. He experienced anxiety, insomnia, and felt like a
shell of himself. His relationship with Cynthia, his girlfriend,
suffered as he became withdrawn and unable to explain the nature of his
work.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sama’s Response</strong>: When some workers involved in
the project began to express their distress to the media, Sama
terminated the contract with OpenAI abruptly. Okinyi was reassigned to a
new project unrelated to content moderation, but his mental health
continued to decline.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Financial Struggles</strong>: After leaving the OpenAI
project, Okinyi found it difficult to secure stable employment in
Nairobi, ultimately leading him to move in with his brother Albert and
take on freelance writing work. However, as OpenAI released ChatGPT,
which sparked concerns about AI’s potential to replace human jobs,
Albert’s writing contracts began to disappear.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reflections and Questions</strong>: In hindsight, Okinyi
wrestles with pride in contributing to making ChatGPT safer but also
questions whether his input was worth the personal cost he
incurred.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The text highlights several themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The exploitation of workers in content moderation roles for AI
projects, often involving distressing and graphic material.</li>
<li>The mental health toll that such work can take on individuals, with
limited support from companies or the industry at large.</li>
<li>The potential for technological advancements (like ChatGPT) to
disrupt labor markets and exacerbate economic struggles for those
involved in creating or moderating AI content.</li>
<li>The need for ethical considerations and improved support systems in
the rapidly developing field of AI, including fair wages, mental health
resources, and transparent communication with workers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The text discusses OpenAI’s development of DALL-E 2, a generative AI
model capable of creating images from textual descriptions. The project
faced internal conflict between the Applied division, focused on
commercialization and user growth, and the Safety clan, concerned about
potential misuse and harm caused by the technology.</p>
<p>The Safety team raised concerns about DALL-E 2 being used to generate
synthetic child sexual abuse material (CSAM), political deepfakes, or
other forms of manipulation and abuse. They urged OpenAI not to release
the model without rigorous testing and evidence that it wouldn’t produce
harm. On the other hand, the Applied division saw releasing DALL-E 2 as
necessary for gaining real-world feedback and staying competitive in the
market.</p>
<p>As a compromise, OpenAI released DALL-E 2 via a “low-key research
preview” on their Labs web app, which allowed them more flexibility to
implement harsh restrictions while still gathering user feedback. This
move satisfied Safety concerns but also limited potential commercial
opportunities for the Applied division.</p>
<p>In an attempt to address data limitations and improve GPT-4’s
performance, Greg Brockman proposed scraping YouTube videos using a
speech-recognition tool called Whisper. Despite concerns about violating
YouTube’s terms of service, he took the risk, resulting in the
collection of over one million hours of footage transcribed into text
for training purposes.</p>
<p>Brockman then developed a new software platform to train GPT-4 using
this data. Initially, the model performed poorly due to low average data
quality, but with reinforcement learning from human feedback and
improvements by contractors, its performance eventually impressed
internal teams.</p>
<p>Throughout the process, OpenAI faced challenges in balancing
idealistic nonprofit values with commercial interests and navigating
conflicting priorities between different divisions within the company.
The text highlights how these tensions manifested in disagreements over
releasing DALL-E 2, developing GPT-4, and addressing issues like CSAM
generation.</p>
<p>The text discusses the rapid growth and commercialization of OpenAI,
focusing on their AI models, particularly ChatGPT, and the impact this
had on both the company and its partner, Microsoft. The narrative begins
with OpenAI’s internal off-site meeting in October 2022, where the
company’s progress was showcased to employees, including a demo of
GPT-4’s capabilities by CEO Sam Altman using his wife Anna’s medical
diagnosis story.</p>
<p>Following this off-site, rumors circulated about competitors like
Anthropic developing similar chatbots, prompting OpenAI to expedite the
release of their own chatbot using GPT-3.5 with a new interface. This
was initially presented as a “low-key research preview” and not a full
product launch, but its popularity skyrocketed, far surpassing initial
expectations.</p>
<p>The sudden success of ChatGPT put immense strain on OpenAI’s
infrastructure, causing server crashes and an inability to scale up
quickly enough due to GPU shortages. The trust and safety team struggled
with limited resources and hastily implemented reactive enforcement
measures to moderate user behavior.</p>
<p>This rapid expansion led to a significant shift in company culture as
OpenAI grew from a small, mission-driven nonprofit into a large
corporation. Many employees experienced a lack of psychological safety,
poor management, and confusing priorities. The need for quick hiring
exacerbated tensions between maintaining high talent density and
managing bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Microsoft was also surprised by ChatGPT’s success and initially
displeased that it overshadowed their own chatbot plans. However, the
positive reception of OpenAI’s technology led Microsoft to reorient its
AI strategy, allocating more resources to support OpenAI and integrating
generative AI into various products like Bing and Microsoft 365.</p>
<p>As ChatGPT gained traction, OpenAI introduced paid versions, APIs,
and GPT-4, leading to increased competition with Microsoft for customers
while also facing challenges in controlling costs due to high GPU
demands and massive fraud on their API. The text concludes by discussing
the broader implications of AI development and resource extraction,
particularly in Chile, where rapid expansion of data centers threatens
local communities and ecosystems.</p>
<p>The text discusses the expansion of data centers in Latin America,
focusing on Chile and Uruguay, and the resistance against them by local
communities and activists. In both countries, severe droughts have
exacerbated water shortages, making it a contentious issue when
multinational corporations like Google and Microsoft propose building
data centers that require large amounts of water for cooling
systems.</p>
<p>In Chile, the community of Quilicura opposed Microsoft’s plan to
build a data center due to concerns about water usage during the ongoing
drought. Rodrigo Vallejos, a law student, and Alexandra Arancibia,
co-founded Resistencia Socioambiental Quilicura, an activism group that
researched and criticized Microsoft’s proposed data center. They
highlighted inconsistencies between the company’s environmentally
friendly discourse and its lack of implementation of global innovation
standards in third-world countries like Chile.</p>
<p>Marina Otero Verzier, a researcher at Nieuwe Instituut, and other
international collaborators joined forces to support Resistencia
Socioambiental Quilicura. They developed a workshop for architecture
students from around Santiago, inviting them to reimagine what data
centers could look like in Quilicura. The students proposed designs that
integrated the data center with the local wetland ecosystem, making
water usage visible and promoting environmental restoration.</p>
<p>In Uruguay, Daniel Pena, a sociology researcher at Universidad de la
República, challenged Google’s proposal for a water-using data center.
After filing public information requests and receiving no response, Pena
evoked the country’s constitutional water clause, eventually winning a
court case that revealed Google planned to use two million gallons of
drinking water daily. This sparked protests against both Google and
other industries for squandering freshwater resources during the
drought.</p>
<p>The narrative also touches upon the political context in Chile, where
left-wing President Gabriel Boric Font has been under pressure to expand
mining and data center projects, despite his initial promises of
environmental protections. Activists like Vallejos and Arancibia, along
with researchers like Pena, have successfully influenced policy
discussions around AI development in Chile by advocating for a more
decolonial approach that considers the country’s historical experiences
with extractivism.</p>
<p>The chapter concludes by discussing Sam Altman’s testimony before
Congress on behalf of OpenAI. Altman advocated for regulation that would
allow OpenAI to maintain its innovative edge while avoiding
accountability for existing issues such as labor, environmental impact,
and privacy concerns. His testimony was part of a broader campaign by
OpenAI to engage with US lawmakers following the success of ChatGPT,
aiming to shape AI policy discussions according to their interests.</p>
<p>The narrative revolves around Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, and his
sister Annie Altman, highlighting their complex relationship and the
societal implications of AI technology.</p>

that her mother had retained control over their father’s retirement
funds, denying Annie access to the money intended for her. This led to a
series of financial appeals from Annie to her family, which were mostly
declined, with the family citing concerns about enabling harmful
behaviors and emphasizing the importance of financial
independence.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Escalating Crisis</strong>: Despite her family’s attempts
to support her, Annie faced housing insecurity, food insecurity, and
healthcare access issues. She turned to sex work as a means of survival,
which further strained her relationship with the family. Sam Altman,
meanwhile, offered to pay her rent but not home ownership, as he
believed this arrangement would prevent her from selling the property
and imposing their views on her life decisions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Public Revelation</strong>: In 2023, Elizabeth Weil’s New
York magazine profile of Sam Altman revealed Annie’s existence and the
financial and emotional turmoil she had faced. This public disclosure
sparked a family crisis, with Sam and his siblings issuing a denial of
her allegations and characterizing her as mentally unstable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AI Technology and Societal Implications</strong>: The
narrative also touches on the broader implications of AI technology,
highlighting the disparity between the dreams of AI proponents like Sam
Altman (ending poverty, improving healthcare) and the real-life
struggles faced by individuals like Annie. Despite advancements in AI,
it has not alleviated Annie’s desperation, suggesting that the
technology may entrap vulnerable populations rather than empower
them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Family Dynamics</strong>: The story sheds light on Sam
Altman’s complex relationship with his sister and raises questions about
his leadership style and personal values. While he is seen as generous
and self-serving, there are concerns that his actions may reflect a more

presents.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In this narrative, the story revolves around Sam Altman, the CEO of
OpenAI, and the growing concerns about his leadership within the
company. The main issues revolve around Altman’s untrustworthiness, lack
of transparency, manipulation tactics, and potential abusive
behavior.</p>
<p>Mira Murati, the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at OpenAI, becomes
increasingly aware of these problems as she navigates the complex
internal dynamics of the company. She frequently finds herself in a
position of having to clean up after Altman’s decisions and behaviors,
which often lead to confusion, conflict, and mistrust among
employees.</p>
<p>The narrative highlights several key instances illustrating Altman’s
problematic leadership:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Manipulation and Misinformation</strong>: Altman is
accused of manipulating information and situations to suit his desires
or agendas. For instance, he tells different people different things
about the same issue, causing confusion and mistrust within the
leadership team.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Honesty</strong>: Murati, Sutskever (a co-founder
and Chief Scientist), and other senior leaders express concerns about
Altman’s lack of honesty. They describe instances where Altman either
says one thing to their faces and another behind their backs or simply
lies outright.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Abuse Allegations</strong>: Annie, Sam’s sister, publicly
accuses him of sexual, physical, emotional, verbal, financial, and
technological abuse during her childhood. Although not directly part of
the internal discussions, these allegations add another layer to
concerns about Altman’s character and behavior.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mismanagement</strong>: There are also instances where
Altman is accused of neglecting processes (both for AI safety reasons
and company operations), attempting to skip necessary reviews (like DSB
review for GPT-4 Turbo), and skirting written records, making it
difficult to prove his statements or actions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Undermining Trust</strong>: The independent board
directors, Toner, McCauley, and D’Angelo, lose trust in Altman after
discovering multiple instances of dishonesty and manipulation. They
decide that his behaviors are not only detrimental to the company’s
operations but also unacceptable for someone leading a powerful AI
organization like OpenAI.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Coup Accusation</strong>: After the board decides to
remove Altman, he and Brockman claim it was a coup orchestrated by
Sutskever, causing a rift within the company and making key stakeholders
question the decision.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Leadership Revolt</strong>: Faced with the hostile
reaction from employees and leaders, Sutskever pleads for
reconsideration of the decision. Meanwhile, Murati, initially supportive
but not part of the board’s deliberations, begins to doubt her ability
to lead effectively in such a tumultuous environment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In response to these issues, the independent board directors
ultimately decide to remove Altman as CEO and install Murati as interim
CEO. However, the aftermath is marked by internal strife, with many key
figures—including some close allies of the directors—resigning in
protest or expressing doubts about the decision. This series of events
highlights the complexities and potential pitfalls of addressing
leadership issues within a high-stakes organization like OpenAI.</p>
<p>The text describes a series of events and crises at OpenAI, a company
focused on artificial intelligence research. The main characters
involved are Sam Altman (CEO), Greg Brockman (President), Mira Murati
(CTO), Ilya Sutskever (former co-founder and chief scientist), and other
executives, board members, and employees.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Board Crisis</strong>: The story begins with a board
crisis at OpenAI, where three independent directors question Altman’s
leadership due to concerns about his candidness in communications. They
consider replacing him as CEO or adding new board members. During this
time, Altman regains support from employees, including Murati and
Sutskever, who leave the company under turbulent circumstances.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Equity Controversy</strong>: A significant controversy
arises when it is revealed that OpenAI has a clawback clause in its exit
agreements, which could potentially strip former employees of their
vested equity if they do not sign nondisparagement agreements. This
discovery angers many current and former employees, as it undermines
trust within the company.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Johansson Scandal</strong>: Another major crisis occurs
when Scarlett Johansson releases a statement accusing OpenAI of using a
voice that sounds strikingly similar to hers without permission or
compensation. This situation intensifies existing tensions and raises
concerns about the company’s ethics, particularly regarding AI-generated
